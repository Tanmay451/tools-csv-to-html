<b>Job Title:			</b>     Agricultural and Food Scientists<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Agricultural and food scientists research ways to improve the efficiency and safety of agricultural establishments and products.</p>,<p>Agricultural and food scientists typically do the following:</p>,<p>Agricultural and food scientists play an important role in maintaining and expanding the nation’s food supply. Many work in basic or applied research and development. Basic research seeks to understand the biological and chemical processes by which crops and livestock grow. Applied research seeks to discover ways to improve the quality, quantity, and safety of agricultural products.</p>,<p>Many agricultural and food scientists work with little supervision, forming their own hypotheses and developing their research methods. In addition, they often lead teams of technicians or students who help in their research. Agricultural and food scientists who are employed in private industry may need to travel between different worksites.</p>,<p>The following are types of agricultural and food scientists:</p>,<p><strong><em>Animal scientists</em></strong> typically conduct research on domestic farm animals. With a focus on food production, they explore animal genetics, nutrition, reproduction, diseases, growth, and development. They work to develop efficient ways to produce and process meat, poultry, eggs, and milk. Animal scientists may crossbreed animals to make them more productive or improve other characteristics. They advise farmers on how to upgrade housing for animals, lower animal death rates, increase growth rates, or otherwise increase the quality and efficiency of livestock.</p>,<p><strong><em>Food scientists and technologists</em></strong> use chemistry, biology, and other sciences to study the basic elements of food. They analyze the nutritional content of food, discover new food sources, and research ways to make processed foods safe and healthy. Food technologists generally work in product development, applying findings from food science research to develop new or better ways of selecting, preserving, processing, packaging, and distributing food. Some food scientists use problem-solving techniques from nanotechnology—the science of manipulating matter on an atomic scale—to develop sensors that can detect contaminants in food. Other food scientists enforce government regulations, inspecting food-processing areas to ensure that they are sanitary and meet waste management standards.</p>,<p><strong><em>Plant scientists</em></strong> work to improve crop yields and advise food and crop developers about techniques that could enhance production. They may develop ways to control pests and weeds.</p>,<p><strong><em>Soil scientists</em></strong> examine the composition of soil, how it affects plant or crop growth, and how alternative soil treatments affect crop productivity. They develop methods of conserving and managing soil that farmers and forestry companies can use. Because soil science is closely related to environmental science, people trained in soil science also work to ensure environmental quality and effective land use.</p>,<p>Agricultural and food scientists in private industry commonly work for food production companies, farms, and processing plants. They may improve inspection standards or overall food quality. They spend their time in a laboratory, where they do tests and experiments, or in the field, where they take samples or assess overall conditions. Other agricultural and food scientists work for pharmaceutical companies, where they use biotechnology processes to develop drugs or other medical products. Some look for ways to process agricultural products into fuels, such as ethanol produced from corn.</p>,<p>At universities, agricultural and food scientists do research and investigate new methods of improving animal or soil health, nutrition, and other facets of food quality. They also write grants to organizations, such as the <a class="external" href="http://www.usda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) or the <a class="external" href="http://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH), to get funding for their research. For more information on professors who teach agricultural and food science at universities, see the profile on <u><a href="/ooh/education-training-and-library/postsecondary-teachers.htm">postsecondary teachers</a></u>.</p>,<p>In the federal government, agricultural and food scientists conduct research on animal safety and on methods of improving food and crop production. They spend most of their time conducting clinical trials or developing experiments on animal and plant subjects.</p>,<p>Agricultural and food scientists may eventually present their findings in peer-reviewed journals or other publications.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     Bachelor's degree<br><b> job:		</b><li>Conduct research and experiments to improve the productivity and sustainability of field crops and farm animals</li>,<li>Create new food products and develop new and better ways to process, package, and deliver them</li>,<li>Study the composition of soil as it relates to plant growth, and research ways to improve it</li>,<li>Communicate research findings to the scientific community, food producers, and the public</li>,<li>Travel between facilities to oversee the implementation of new projects</li>
