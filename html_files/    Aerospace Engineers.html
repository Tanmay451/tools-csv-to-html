<b>Job Title:			</b>     Aerospace Engineers<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Aerospace engineers design primarily aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles. In addition, they create and test prototypes to make sure that they function according to design.</p>,<p>Aerospace engineers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Aerospace engineers may develop new technologies for use in aviation, defense systems, and spacecraft. They often specialize in areas such as aerodynamic fluid flow; structural design; guidance, navigation, and control; instrumentation and communication; robotics; and propulsion and combustion.</p>,<p>Aerospace engineers can specialize in designing different types of aerospace products, such as commercial and military airplanes and helicopters; remotely piloted aircraft and rotorcraft; spacecraft, including launch vehicles and satellites; and military missiles and rockets.</p>,<p>Aerospace engineers often become experts in one or more related fields: aerodynamics, thermodynamics, materials, celestial mechanics, flight mechanics, propulsion, acoustics, and guidance and control systems.</p>,<p>Aerospace engineers typically specialize in one of two types of engineering: aeronautical or astronautical.</p>,<p><strong><em>Aeronautical engineers</em></strong> work with aircraft. They are involved primarily in designing aircraft and propulsion systems and in studying the aerodynamic performance of aircraft and construction materials. They work with the theory, technology, and practice of flight within the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>,<p><strong><em>Astronautical engineers</em></strong> work with the science and technology of spacecraft and how they perform inside and outside the Earth’s atmosphere. This includes work on small satellites such as cubesats, and traditional large satellites.  </p>,<p>Aeronautical and astronautical engineers face different environmental and operational issues in designing aircraft and spacecraft. However, the two fields overlap a great deal because they both depend on the basic principles of physics.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     Bachelor's degree<br><b> job:		</b><li>Direct and coordinate the design, manufacture, and testing of aircraft and aerospace products</li>,<li>Assess proposals for projects to determine if they are technically and financially feasible</li>,<li>Determine if proposed projects will result in safe operations that meet the defined goals</li>,<li>Evaluate designs to see that the products meet engineering principles, customer requirements, and environmental regulations</li>,<li>Develop acceptance criteria for design methods, quality standards, sustainment after delivery, and completion dates</li>,<li>Ensure that projects meet quality standards</li>,<li>Inspect malfunctioning or damaged products to identify sources of problems and possible solutions</li>
