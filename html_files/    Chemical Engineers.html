<b>Job Title:			</b>     Chemical Engineers<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Chemical engineers apply the principles of chemistry, biology, physics, and math to solve problems that involve the production or use of chemicals, fuel, drugs, food, and many other products. They design processes and equipment for large-scale manufacturing, plan and test production methods and byproducts treatment, and direct facility operations.</p>,<p>Chemical engineers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Some chemical engineers, known as <em><strong>process engineers</strong></em>, specialize in a particular process, such as oxidation (a reaction of oxygen with chemicals to make other chemicals) or polymerization (making plastics and resins).</p>,<p>Others specialize in a particular field, such as nanomaterials (extremely small substances) or biological engineering. Still others specialize in developing specific products.</p>,<p>In addition, chemical engineers work in the production of energy, electronics, food, clothing, and paper. They must understand how the manufacturing process affects the environment and the safety of workers and consumers.</p>,<p>Chemical engineers also conduct research in the life sciences, biotechnology, and business services.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     Bachelor's degree<br><b> job:		</b><li>Conduct research to develop new and improved manufacturing processes</li>,<li>Establish safety procedures for those working with dangerous chemicals</li>,<li>Develop processes for separating components of liquids and gases, or for generating electrical currents, by using controlled chemical processes</li>,<li>Design and plan the layout of equipment</li>,<li>Conduct tests and monitor the performance of processes throughout production</li>,<li>Troubleshoot problems with manufacturing processes</li>,<li>Evaluate equipment and processes to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations</li>,<li>Estimate production costs for management</li>
