<b>Job Title:			</b>     Masonry Workers<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Masonry workers, also known as <em>masons,</em> use bricks, concrete blocks, concrete, and natural and manmade stones to build walls, walkways, fences, and other masonry structures.</p>,<p>Masons typically do the following:</p>,<p>Masonry materials are some of the most common and durable materials used in construction. Brick, block, and stone structures can last for hundreds of years. Concrete—a mixture of cement, sand, gravel, and water—is the foundation for everything from decorative patios and floors to huge dams or miles of roadways.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of masons:</p>,<p><strong><em>Brickmasons</em></strong> and <strong><em>blockmasons</em></strong>—often called <em>bricklayers</em>—build and repair walls, floors, partitions, fireplaces, chimneys, and other structures with brick, terra cotta, precast masonry panels, concrete block, and other masonry materials.<strong><em> </em></strong><em>Pointing, cleaning, and caulking workers<strong> </strong></em>are brickmasons who repair brickwork, particularly on older structures from which mortar has come loose.<strong><em> </em></strong><em>Refractory masons</em> are brickmasons who specialize in installing firebrick, gunite, castables, and refractory tile in high-temperature boilers, furnaces, cupolas, ladles, and soaking pits in industrial establishments.</p>,<p><strong><em>Cement masons</em></strong> <strong><em>and</em></strong> <strong><em>concrete finishers</em></strong> place and finish concrete. They may color concrete surfaces, expose aggregate (small stones) in walls and sidewalks, or make concrete beams, columns, and panels. Throughout the process of pouring, leveling, and finishing concrete, cement masons monitor how the wind, heat, or cold affects the curing of the concrete. They use their knowledge of the characteristics of concrete to determine what is happening to it and take measures to prevent defects. Some small jobs, such as constructing sidewalks, may require the use of a supportive wire mesh called lath. On larger jobs, such as constructing building foundations, <a href="/ooh/construction-and-extraction/structural-iron-and-steel-workers.htm"><u>reinforcing iron and rebar workers</u></a> install the reinforcing mesh.</p>,<p><strong><em>Stonemasons</em></strong> build stone walls, as well as set stone exteriors and floors. They work with two types of stone: natural-cut stone, such as marble, granite, and limestone; and artificial stone, made from concrete, marble chips, or other masonry materials. Using a special hammer or a diamond-blade saw, workers cut stone to make various shapes and sizes. Some stonemasons specialize in setting marble, which is similar to setting large pieces of stone.</p>,<p><strong><em>Terrazzo workers</em></strong> <strong><em>and</em></strong> <strong><em>finishers,</em></strong><em> </em>also known as <em>terrazzo masons</em>, create decorative walkways, floors, patios, and panels. Much of the preliminary work of pouring, leveling, and finishing concrete for terrazzo is similar to that of cement masons. Epoxy terrazzo requires less base preparation and is significantly thinner when completed. Terrazzo workers create decorative finishes by blending fine marble chips into the epoxy, resin, or cement, which is often colored. Once the terrazzo is thoroughly set, workers correct any depressions or imperfections with a grinder to create a smooth, uniform finish. Terrazzo workers also install decorative toppings or polishing compounds to new or existing concrete.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     <br><b> job:		</b><li>Read blueprints or drawings to calculate materials needed</li>,<li>Lay out patterns, forms, or foundations according to plans</li>,<li>Break or cut materials to required size</li>,<li>Mix mortar or grout and spread it onto a slab or foundation</li>,<li>Clean excess mortar with trowels and other hand tools</li>,<li>Construct corners with a corner pole or by building a corner pyramid</li>,<li>Align structures vertically and horizontally, using levels and plumbs</li>,<li>Clean and polish surfaces with hand or power tools</li>,<li>Fill expansion joints with the appropriate caulking materials</li>
