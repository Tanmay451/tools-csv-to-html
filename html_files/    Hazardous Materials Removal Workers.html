<b>Job Title:			</b>     Hazardous Materials Removal Workers<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Hazardous materials (hazmat) removal workers identify and dispose of asbestos, lead, radioactive waste, and other hazardous materials. They also neutralize and clean up materials that are flammable, corrosive, or toxic.</p>,<p>Hazmat removal workers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Hazmat removal workers clean up materials that are harmful to people and the environment. They usually work in teams and follow strict instructions and guidelines. The specific duties of hazmat removal workers depend on the substances that are targeted and the location of the cleanup. For example, some workers may remove and treat radioactive materials generated by nuclear facilities and power plants. They break down contaminated items such as “glove boxes,” which are used to process radioactive materials, and they clean and decontaminate closed or decommissioned (taken out of service) facilities.</p>,<p>Hazmat removal workers may clean up hazardous materials in response to natural or human-made disasters and accidents, such as those involving trains, trucks, or other vehicles transporting hazardous materials.</p>,<p>Workers dealing with radiation may also measure, record, and report radiation levels; operate high-pressure cleaning equipment for decontamination; and package radioactive materials for removal or storage.</p>,<p>In addition, workers may prepare and transport hazardous materials for treatment, storage, or disposal in accordance with <a class="external" href="http://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) or <a class="external" href="http://www.osha.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) regulations. Using equipment such as forklifts, earthmoving machinery, and trucks, workers move materials from contaminated sites to incinerators, landfills, or storage facilities. They also organize and track the locations of items in these facilities.</p>,<p><strong><em>Asbestos abatement workers </em></strong>and <strong><em>lead abatement workers</em></strong> remove asbestos and lead, respectively, from buildings and structures, particularly those which are being renovated or demolished. Most of this work is in older buildings that were originally built with asbestos insulation and lead-based paints—both of which are now banned.</p>,<p>Asbestos and lead abatement workers apply chemicals to surfaces, such as walls and ceilings, in order to soften asbestos or remove lead-based paint. Once the chemicals are applied, workers cut out asbestos from the surfaces or strip the walls. They package the residue or paint chips and place them in approved bags or containers for proper disposal. Lead abatement workers operate sandblasters, high-pressure water sprayers, and other tools to remove paint. Asbestos abatement workers also use scrapers or vacuums to remove asbestos from buildings.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     High school diploma or equivalent<br><b> job:		</b><li>Follow safety procedures before, during, and after cleanup</li>,<li>Comply with state and federal laws regarding waste disposal</li>,<li>Test hazardous materials to determine the proper way to clean up</li>,<li>Construct scaffolding or build containment areas before cleaning up</li>,<li>Remove, neutralize, or clean up hazardous materials that are found or spilled</li>,<li>Clean contaminated equipment for reuse</li>,<li>Package, transport, or store hazardous materials</li>,<li>Keep records of cleanup activities</li>
