<b>Job Title:			</b>     Jewelers and Precious Stone and Metal Workers<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Jewelers and precious stone and metal workers design, construct, adjust, repair, appraise and sell jewelry.</p>,<p>Jewelers and precious stone and metal workers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Technology is helping to produce high-quality jewelry at a reduced cost and in less time than traditional methods allow. For example, lasers are often used for cutting and improving the quality of stones, for intricate engraving or design work, and for inscribing personal messages on jewelry. Jewelers also use lasers to weld metals together without seams or blemishes, improving the quality and appearance of jewelry.</p>,<p>Some manufacturing firms use computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) to make product design easier and to automate some steps. With CAD, jewelers can create a model of a piece of jewelry on a computer and then view the effect of changing different aspects—for example, the design, the stone, or the setting—before cutting a stone or taking other costly steps. With CAM, they can then create a mold of the piece, which makes producing many copies easy.</p>,<p>Some jewelers also use CAD software to design custom jewelry. They let the customer review the design on a computer and see the effect of changes, so that the customer is satisfied before committing to the expense of a customized piece of jewelry.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of jewelers and precious stone and metal workers:</p>,<p><strong><em>Bench jewelers, </em></strong>also known as metalsmiths, silversmiths, goldsmiths, and platinumsmiths, are the most common type of jewelers. They possess a wide array of skills. They usually do tasks ranging from simple jewelry cleaning and repair to making molds and pieces from scratch. Some specialize in particular tasks such as repairs, hand engraving, stringing, wax carving/model making, enameling, stone cutting, soldering, stone setting, and hand building.</p>,<p><strong><em>Gemologists</em></strong> analyze, describe, and certify the quality and characteristics of gemstones. After using microscopes, computerized tools, and other grading instruments to examine gemstones or finished pieces of jewelry, they write reports certifying that the items are of a particular quality. Most gemologists have completed the Graduate Gemologist program through the <a class="external" href="https://www.gia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemological Institute of America</a>.</p>,<p><strong><em>Jewelry appraisers</em></strong> carefully examine jewelry to determine its value and then write appraisal documents. They determine value by researching the jewelry market and by using reference books, auction catalogs, price lists, and the Internet. They may work for jewelry stores, appraisal firms, auction houses, pawnbrokers, or insurance companies. Many gemologists also become appraisers.</p>,<p><strong><em>Jewelry designers </em></strong>create design concepts and manage the prototype and model-making process.</p>,<p><strong><em>Production jewelers</em></strong> fabricate and assemble pieces in a manufacturing setting and typically work on one aspect of the manufacturing process.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     High school diploma or equivalent<br><b> job:		</b><li>Design and create jewelry from precious metals and stones</li>,<li>Examine and grade diamonds and other gems</li>,<li>Clean and polish jewelry using polishing wheels and chemical baths</li>,<li>Repair jewelry by replacing broken clasps, altering ring sizes, or resetting stones</li>,<li>Smooth joints and rough spots and polish smoothed areas</li>,<li>Compute the costs of labor and material for new pieces and repairs</li>,<li>Model new pieces with carved wax or computer-aided design, and then cast them in metal</li>,<li>Shape metal to hold the gems in pieces of jewelry</li>,<li>Solder pieces together and insert stones</li>
