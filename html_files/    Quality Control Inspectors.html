<b>Job Title:			</b>     Quality Control Inspectors<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Quality control inspectors examine products and materials for defects or deviations from specifications.</p>,<p>Quality control inspectors typically do the following:</p>,<p>Quality control inspectors monitor quality standards for nearly all manufactured products, including foods, textiles, clothing, glassware, motor vehicles, electronic components, computers, and structural steel. Specific job duties vary across the wide range of industries in which these inspectors work.</p>,<p>Quality control workers rely on many tools to do their jobs. Although some still use hand-held measurement devices, such as calipers and alignment gauges, workers more commonly operate electronic inspection equipment, such as coordinate-measuring machines (CMMs) and three-dimensional (3D) scanners. Inspectors testing electrical devices may use voltmeters, ammeters, and ohmmeters to test potential difference, current flow, and resistance, respectively.</p>,<p>Quality control workers record the results of their inspections through test reports. When they find defects, inspectors notify supervisors and help to analyze and correct production problems.</p>,<p>In some firms, the inspection process is completely automated, with advanced vision inspection systems installed at one or several points in the production process. Inspectors in these firms monitor the equipment, review output, and conduct random product checks.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of quality control inspectors:</p>,<p><strong><em>Inspectors</em></strong> mark, tag, or note problems. They may reject defective items outright, send them for repair, or fix minor problems themselves. If the product is acceptable, the inspector certifies it. Inspectors may further specialize in the following jobs:</p>,<p><strong><em>Samplers</em></strong> test or inspect a sample for malfunctions or defects during a batch or production run.</p>,<p><strong><em>Sorters</em></strong> separate goods according to length, size, fabric type, or color.</p>,<p><strong><em>Testers</em></strong> repeatedly test existing products or prototypes under real-world conditions. Through these tests, manufacturers determine how long a product will last, what parts will break down first, and how to improve durability.</p>,<p><strong><em>Weighers</em></strong> weigh quantities of materials for use in production.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     High school diploma or equivalent<br><b> job:		</b><li>Read blueprints and specifications</li>,<li>Monitor operations to ensure that they meet production standards</li>,<li>Recommend adjustments to the assembly or production process</li>,<li>Inspect, test, or measure materials or products being produced</li>,<li>Measure products with rulers, calipers, gauges, or micrometers</li>,<li>Operate electronic inspection equipment and software</li>,<li>Accept or reject finished items</li>,<li>Remove all products and materials that fail to meet specifications</li>,<li>Report inspection and test data such as weights, temperatures, grades, moisture content, and quantities inspected</li>,<li><strong><em>Materials inspectors</em></strong> check products by sight, sound, or feel to locate imperfections such as cuts, scratches, missing pieces, or crooked seams.</li>,<li><strong><em>Mechanical inspectors</em></strong> generally verify that parts fit, move correctly, and are properly lubricated.
