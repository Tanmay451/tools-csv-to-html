<b>Job Title:			</b>     Drafters<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Drafters use software to convert the designs of architects and engineers into technical drawings. Most workers specialize in architectural, civil, electrical, or mechanical drafting and use technical drawings to help design everything from microchips to skyscrapers.</p>,<p>Drafters typically do the following:</p>,<p>Some drafters are referred to as <em>CAD operators</em>. Using CAD systems, drafters create and store technical drawings digitally. These drawings contain information on how to build a structure or machine, the dimensions of the project, and what materials are needed to complete the project.</p>,<p>Drafters work with CAD to create schematics that can be viewed, printed, or programmed directly into building information modeling (BIM) systems. These systems allow drafters, architects, construction managers, and engineers to create and collaborate on digital models of physical buildings and machines. Through three-dimensional rendering, BIM software allows designers and engineers to see how different elements in their projects work together.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of drafters:</p>,<p><strong><em>Architectural drafters</em></strong> draw structural features and details for buildings and other construction projects. These workers may specialize in a type of building, such as residential or commercial. They may also specialize by the materials used, such as steel, wood, or reinforced concrete.</p>,<p><strong><em>Civil drafters</em></strong> prepare topographical maps used in construction and civil engineering projects, such as highways, bridges, and dams.</p>,<p><strong><em>Electrical drafters</em></strong> prepare wiring diagrams that construction workers use to install and repair electrical equipment and wiring in power plants, electrical distribution systems, and residential and commercial buildings.</p>,<p><strong><em>Electronics drafters</em></strong> produce wiring diagrams, assembly diagrams for circuit boards, and layout drawings used in manufacturing and in installing and repairing electronic devices and components.</p>,<p><strong><em>Mechanical drafters</em></strong> prepare layouts that show the details for a variety of machinery and mechanical tools and devices, such as medical equipment. These layouts indicate dimensions, fastening methods, and other requirements for assembly. Mechanical drafters sometimes create production molds.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     Associate's degree<br><b> job:		</b><li>Design plans using computer-aided design (CAD) software</li>,<li>Work from rough sketches and specifications created by engineers and architects</li>,<li>Design products with engineering and manufacturing techniques</li>,<li>Add details to architectural plans from their knowledge of building techniques</li>,<li>Specify dimensions, materials, and procedures for new products</li>,<li>Work under the supervision of engineers or architects</li>
