<b>Job Title:			</b>     Industrial Machinery Mechanics, Machinery Maintenance Workers, and Millwrights<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Industrial machinery mechanics and machinery maintenance workers maintain and repair factory equipment and other industrial machinery, such as conveying systems, production machinery, and packaging equipment. Millwrights install, dismantle, repair, reassemble, and move machinery in factories, power plants, and construction sites.</p>,<p>Industrial machinery mechanics, machinery maintenance workers, and millwrights typically do the following:</p>,<p><strong><em>Industrial machinery mechanics</em></strong>, also called <em>maintenance machinists</em>, keep machines in working order by detecting and correcting errors before the machine or the products it produces are damaged. Many of these machines are increasingly run by computers. Industrial machinery mechanics use technical manuals, their understanding of industrial equipment, and observation to determine the cause of a problem. For example, after detecting a vibration from a machine, they must decide whether it is the result of worn belts, weak motor bearings, or some other problem. They may use computerized diagnostic systems and vibration analysis techniques to help figure out the source of problems. Examples of machines they may work with are robotic welding arms, automobile assembly line conveyor belts, and hydraulic lifts.</p>,<p>After diagnosing a problem, the industrial machinery mechanic may take the equipment apart to repair or replace the necessary parts. Once a repair is made, mechanics test a machine to ensure that it is operating correctly.</p>,<p>In addition to working with hand tools, mechanics commonly use lathes, grinders, and drill presses. Many also are required to weld.</p>,<p><strong><em>Machinery maintenance workers </em></strong>do basic maintenance and repairs on machines. They clean and lubricate machinery, perform basic diagnostic tests, check the performance of the machine, and test damaged machine parts to determine whether major repairs are necessary.</p>,<p>Machinery maintenance workers must follow machine specifications and adhere to maintenance schedules. They perform minor repairs, generally leaving major repairs to industrial machinery mechanics.</p>,<p>Maintenance workers use a variety of tools to do repairs and preventive maintenance. For example, they may use a screwdriver or socket wrenches to adjust a motor’s alignment, or they might use a hoist to lift a heavy printing press off the ground.</p>,<p><strong><em>Millwrights</em></strong> install, maintain, and disassemble industrial machines. Putting together a machine can take a few days or several weeks.</p>,<p>Millwrights perform repairs that include replacing worn or defective parts of machines. They also may be involved in taking apart the entire machine, a common situation when a manufacturing plant needs to clear floor space for new machinery. In taking apart a machine, millwrights carefully disassemble, categorize, and package each part of the machine.</p>,<p>Millwrights use a variety of hand tools, such as hammers and levels, as well as equipment for welding, brazing, and cutting. They also use measuring tools, such as micrometers, measuring tapes, lasers, and other precision-measuring devices. On large projects, they commonly use cranes and trucks. When millwrights and managers determine the best place for a machine, millwrights use forklifts, hoists, winches, cranes, and other equipment to bring the parts to the desired location.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     High school diploma or equivalent<br><b> job:		</b><li>Read technical manuals to understand equipment and controls</li>,<li>Disassemble machinery and equipment when there is a problem</li>,<li>Repair or replace broken or malfunctioning components</li>,<li>Perform tests and run initial batches to make sure that the machine is running smoothly</li>,<li>Detect minor problems by performing basic diagnostic tests</li>,<li>Test malfunctioning machinery to determine whether major repairs are needed</li>,<li>Adjust and calibrate equipment and machinery to optimal specifications</li>,<li>Clean and lubricate equipment or machinery</li>,<li>Move machinery and equipment</li>
