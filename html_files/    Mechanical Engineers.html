<b>Job Title:			</b>     Mechanical Engineers<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Mechanical engineers research, design, develop, build, and test mechanical and thermal sensors and devices, including tools, engines, and machines.</p>,<p>Mechanical engineers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest engineering fields. Mechanical engineers design and oversee the manufacture of many products ranging from medical devices to new batteries.</p>,<p>Mechanical engineers design power-producing machines, such as electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas turbines, as well as power-using machines, such as refrigeration and air-conditioning systems.</p>,<p>Mechanical engineers design other machines inside buildings, such as elevators and escalators. They also design material-handling systems, such as conveyor systems and automated transfer stations.</p>,<p>Like other engineers, mechanical engineers use computers extensively. Mechanical engineers are routinely responsible for the integration of sensors, controllers, and machinery. Computer technology helps mechanical engineers create and analyze designs, run simulations and test how a machine is likely to work, interact with connected systems, and generate specifications for parts.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of mechanical engineers:</p>,<p><strong><em>Auto research engineers</em></strong> seek to improve the performance of cars. These engineers work to improve traditional features of cars such as suspension, and they also work on aerodynamics and new possible fuels.</p>,<p><strong><em>Heating and cooling systems engineers</em></strong> work to create and maintain environmental systems wherever temperatures and humidity must be kept within certain limits. They develop such systems for airplanes, trains, cars, schools, and even computer rooms.</p>,<p><strong><em>Robotic engineers </em></strong>plan, build, and maintain robots. These engineers plan how robots will use sensors for detecting things based on light or smell, and they design how these sensors will fit into the designs of the robots.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     Bachelor's degree<br><b> job:		</b><li>Analyze problems to see how mechanical and thermal devices might help solve a particular problem</li>,<li>Design or redesign mechanical and thermal devices or subsystems, using analysis and computer-aided design</li>,<li>Investigate equipment failures or difficulties to diagnose faulty operation and to recommend remedies</li>,<li>Develop and test prototypes of devices they design</li>,<li>Analyze the test results and change the design or system as needed</li>,<li>Oversee the manufacturing process for the device</li>
