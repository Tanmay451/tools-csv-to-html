<b>Job Title:			</b>     Civil Engineers<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Civil engineers conceive, design, build, supervise, operate, construct and maintain infrastructure projects and systems in the public and private sector, including roads, buildings, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and systems for water supply and sewage treatment. Many civil engineers work in planning, design, construction, research, and education.</p>,<p>Civil engineers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Civil engineers also must present their findings to the public on topics such as bid proposals, environmental impact statements, or property descriptions.</p>,<p>Many civil engineers hold supervisory or administrative positions ranging from supervisor of a construction site to city engineer, public works director, and city manager. As supervisors, they are tasked with ensuring that safe work practices are followed at construction sites.</p>,<p>Other civil engineers work in design, construction, research, and teaching. Civil engineers work with others on projects and may be assisted by <a href="/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/civil-engineering-technicians.htm"><u>civil engineering technicians</u></a>.</p>,<p>Civil engineers prepare permit documents for work on projects in renewable energy. They verify that the projects will comply with federal, state, and local requirements. These engineers conduct structural analyses for large-scale photovoltaic, or solar energy, projects. They also evaluate the ability of solar array support structures and buildings to tolerate stresses from wind, seismic activity, and other sources. For large-scale wind projects, civil engineers often prepare roadbeds to handle large trucks that haul in the turbines.</p>,<p>Civil engineers work on complex projects, and they can achieve job satisfaction in seeing the project reach completion. They usually specialize in one of several areas.</p>,<p><strong><em>Construction engineers</em></strong> manage construction projects, ensuring that they are scheduled and built in accordance with plans and specifications. These engineers typically are responsible for the design and safety of temporary structures used during construction. They may also oversee budgetary, time-management, and communications aspects of a project.</p>,<p><strong><em>Geotechnical engineers</em></strong> work to make sure that foundations for built objects ranging from streets and buildings to runways and dams, are solid. They focus on how structures built by civil engineers, such as buildings and tunnels, interact with the earth (including soil and rock). In addition, they design and plan for slopes, retaining walls, and tunnels.</p>,<p><strong><em>Structural engineers</em></strong> design and assess major projects, such as buildings, bridges, or dams, to ensure their strength and durability.</p>,<p><strong><em>Transportation engineers</em></strong> plan, design, operate, and maintain everyday systems, such as streets and highways, but they also plan larger projects, such as airports, ship ports, mass transit systems, and harbors.</p>,<p>The work of civil engineers is closely related to the work of <a href="/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/environmental-engineers.htm"><u>environmental engineers</u></a>.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     Bachelor's degree<br><b> job:		</b><li>Analyze long range plans, survey reports, maps, and other data to plan and design projects</li>,<li>Consider construction costs, government regulations, potential environmental hazards, and other factors during the planning and risk-analysis stages of a project</li>,<li>Compile and submit permit applications to local, state, and federal agencies, verifying that projects comply with various regulations</li>,<li>Oversee and analyze the results of soil testing to determine the adequacy and strength of foundations</li>,<li>Analyze the results of tests on building materials, such as concrete, wood, asphalt, or steel, for use in particular projects</li>,<li>Prepare cost estimates for materials, equipment, or labor to determine a project’s economic feasibility</li>,<li>Use design software to plan and design transportation systems, hydraulic systems, and structures in line with industry and government standards</li>,<li>Perform or oversee surveying operations to establish building locations, site layouts, reference points, grades, and elevations to guide construction</li>,<li>Manage the repair, maintenance, and replacement of public and private infrastructure</li>
