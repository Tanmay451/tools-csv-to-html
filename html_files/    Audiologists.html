<b>Job Title:			</b>     Audiologists<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Audiologists diagnose, manage, and treat a patient’s hearing, balance, or related ear problems.</p>,<p>Audiologists typically do the following:</p>,<p>Audiologists use audiometers, computers, and other devices to test patients’ hearing ability and balance. They work to determine the extent of hearing damage and identify the underlying cause. Audiologists measure the loudness at which a person begins to hear sounds and the person’s ability to distinguish between sounds and understand speech.</p>,<p>Before determining treatment options, audiologists evaluate psychological information to measure the impact of hearing loss on a patient. Treatment may include cleaning wax out of ear canals, fitting and checking hearing aids, or working with physicians to fit the patient with cochlear implants to improve hearing. Cochlear implants are tiny devices that are placed under the skin near the ear and deliver electrical impulses directly to the auditory nerve in the brain. This allows a person with certain types of deafness to be able to hear.</p>,<p>Audiologists also counsel patients on other ways to cope with profound hearing loss, such as lip reading or using technology.</p>,<p>Audiologists can help a patient suffering from vertigo or other balance problems. They work with patients and provide them with exercises involving head movement or positioning that might relieve some of their symptoms.</p>,<p>Some audiologists specialize in working with the elderly or with children. Others educate the public on hearing loss prevention. Audiologists may design products to help protect the hearing of workers on the job. Audiologists who are self-employed hire employees, keep records, order equipment and supplies, and complete other tasks related to running a business.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     Doctoral or professional degree<br><b> job:		</b><li>Examine patients who have hearing, balance, or related ear problems</li>,<li>Assess the results of the examination and diagnose problems</li>,<li>Determine and administer treatment to meet patients’ goals</li>,<li>Provide treatment for tinnitus, a condition that causes ringing in the ear</li>,<li>Fit and dispense hearing aids</li>,<li>Counsel patients and their families on ways to listen and communicate, such as lip reading or through technology</li>,<li>Evaluate patients regularly to check on hearing and balance and to continue or change treatment plans</li>,<li>Record patient progress</li>,<li>Research the causes and treatment of hearing and balance disorders</li>,<li>Educate patients on ways to prevent hearing loss</li>
