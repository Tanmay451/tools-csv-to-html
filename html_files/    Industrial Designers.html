<b>Job Title:			</b>     Industrial Designers<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Industrial designers develop the concepts for manufactured products, such as cars, home appliances, and toys. They combine art, business, and engineering to make products that people use every day. Industrial designers consider the function, aesthetics, production costs, and usability of products when developing new product concepts.</p>,<p>Industrial designers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Some industrial designers focus on a particular product category. For example, they may design medical equipment or work on consumer electronics products, such as computers and smart phones. Other designers develop ideas for products such as new bicycles, furniture, housewares, and snowboards.</p>,<p>Other designers, sometimes called <em>user interface designers</em> or <em>interaction designers</em>, focus on the usability of a product, such as an electronic device, and ensure that the product is both simple and enjoyable to use.</p>,<p>Industrial designers imagine how consumers might use a product and test different designs with consumers to see how each design looks and works. Industrial designers often work with <a href="/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/home.htm">engineers</a>, production experts, and <a href="/ooh/business-and-financial/market-research-analysts.htm"><u>market research analysts</u></a> to find out if their designs are feasible. They apply the input from their colleagues’ professional expertise to further develop their designs. For example, industrial designers may work with market research analysts to develop plans to market new product designs to consumers.</p>,<p>Computers are a major tool for industrial designers. Industrial designers use two-dimensional computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) software to sketch ideas, because computers make it easy to make changes and show alternatives. Three-dimensional CAD software is increasingly being used by industrial designers as a tool to transform their two-dimensional designs into models with the help of three-dimensional printers. If they work for manufacturers, they also may use computer-aided industrial design (CAID) software to create specific machine-readable instructions that tell other machines exactly how to build the product.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     Bachelor's degree<br><b> job:		</b><li>Consult with clients to determine requirements for designs</li>,<li>Research the various ways a particular product might be used, and who will use it</li>,<li>Sketch ideas or create renderings, which are images on paper or on a computer that provide a visual of design ideas</li>,<li>Use computer software to develop virtual models of different designs</li>,<li>Create physical prototypes of their designs</li>,<li>Examine materials and manufacturing requirements to determine production costs</li>,<li>Work with other specialists, such as mechanical engineers and manufacturers, to evaluate whether their design concepts will fill needs at a reasonable cost</li>,<li>Evaluate product safety, appearance, and function to determine if a design is practical</li>,<li>Present designs and demonstrate prototypes to clients for approval</li>
