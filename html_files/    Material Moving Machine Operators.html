<b>Job Title:			</b>     Material Moving Machine Operators<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Material moving machine operators use machinery to transport various objects. Some operators move construction materials around building sites or excavate earth from a mine. Others move goods around a warehouse or onto container ships.</p>,<p>Material moving machine operators typically do the following:</p>,<p>In warehouses, most material moving machine operators use forklifts and conveyor belts. Wireless sensors and tags are increasingly being used to keep track of merchandise, allowing operators to locate them faster. Some operators also check goods for damage. These operators usually work closely with <a href="/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/hand-laborers-and-material-movers.htm"><u>hand laborers and material movers</u></a>.</p>,<p>Many operators work for underground and surface mining companies. They help to dig or expose the mine, remove the earth and rock, and extract coal, ore, and other mined materials.</p>,<p>In construction, material moving machine operators remove earth to clear space for buildings. Some work on a building site for the entire length of the construction project. For example, certain material moving machine operators help to construct highrise buildings by transporting materials to workers who are far above ground level.</p>,<p>All material moving machine operators are responsible for the safe operation of their equipment or vehicle.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of material moving machine operators:</p>,<p><strong><em>Conveyor operators and tenders</em></strong> control conveyor systems that move materials on an automatic belt. They move materials to and from places such as storage areas, vehicles, and building sites. They monitor sensors on the conveyor to regulate the speed with which the conveyor belt moves. Operators also may check the shipping order and determine the route that materials take along a conveyor.</p>,<p><strong><em>Crane and tower operators</em></strong> use tower and cable equipment to lift and move materials, machinery, or other heavy objects. From a control station, operators can extend and retract horizontal booms, rotate the superstructure, and lower and raise hooks attached to cables at the end of their crane or tower. Operators usually are guided by workers on the ground who use hand signals or who transmit voice signals through a radio. Most crane and tower operators work at construction sites or major ports, where they load and unload cargo. Some operators work in iron and steel mills.</p>,<p><strong><em>Dredge operators</em></strong> excavate waterways. They operate equipment on the water to remove sand, gravel, or rock from harbors or lakes. Removing these materials helps to prevent erosion and maintain navigable waterways, and allows larger ships to use ports. Dredging also is used to help restore wetlands and maintain beaches.</p>,<p><strong><em>Excavating and loading machine and dragline operators</em></strong> use machines equipped with scoops or shovels. They dig sand, earth, or other materials and load them onto conveyors or into trucks for transport elsewhere. They may also move material within a confined area, such as a construction site. Operators typically receive instructions from workers on the ground through hand signals or through voice signals transmitted by radio. Most of these operators work in construction or mining industries.</p>,<p><strong><em>Hoist and winch operators</em></strong>, also called <strong><em>derrick operators</em></strong>, control the movement of platforms, cables, and cages that transport workers or materials in industrial operations, such as constructing a highrise building. Many of these operators raise platforms far above the ground. Operators regulate the speed of the equipment on the basis of the needs of the workers. Many work in manufacturing, mining, and quarrying industries.</p>,<p><strong><em>Industrial truck and tractor operators</em></strong> drive trucks and tractors that move materials around warehouses, storage yards, or worksites. These trucks, often called forklifts, have a lifting mechanism and forks, which make them useful for moving heavy and large objects. Some industrial truck and tractor operators drive tractors that pull trailers loaded with material around factories or storage areas.</p>,<p><strong><em>Underground mining loading machine operators</em></strong> load coal, ore, and other rocks onto shuttles, mine cars, or conveyors for transport from a mine to the surface. They may use power shovels, hoisting engines equipped with scrapers or scoops, and automatic gathering arms that move materials onto a conveyor. Operators also drive their machines farther into the mine in order to gather more material.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     <br><b> job:		</b><li>Set up and inspect material moving equipment</li>,<li>Control equipment with levers, wheels, or foot pedals</li>,<li>Move material according to a plan or schedule</li>,<li>Signal and direct workers to load, unload, and position materials</li>,<li>Keep a record of the material they move and where they move it to</li>,<li>Make minor repairs to their equipment</li>
