<b>Job Title:			</b>     Metal and Plastic Machine Workers<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Metal and plastic machine workers set up and operate machines that cut, shape, and form metal and plastic materials or pieces.</p>,<p>Metal and plastic machine workers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Consumer products are made with many metal and plastic parts. These parts are produced by machines that are operated by metal and plastic machine workers. In general, these workers are separated into two groups: those who set up machines for operation and those who operate machines during production. Many workers, however, perform both tasks.</p>,<p>Although many workers both set up and operate machines, some may specialize in being a machine setter or a machine operator and tender.</p>,<p><strong><em>Machine setters</em></strong>, or setup workers, prepare the machines before production, perform test runs, and, if necessary, adjust and make minor repairs to the machinery before and during operation.</p>,<p>If, for example, the cutting tool inside a machine becomes dull after extended use, it is common for a setter to remove the tool, use a grinder or file to sharpen it, and reinstall it into the machine. New tools are produced by <a href="/ooh/production/machinists-and-tool-and-die-makers.htm">tool and die makers</a>.</p>,<p>After installing the tools into a machine, setup workers often produce the initial batch of goods, inspect the products, and turn the machine over to an operator.</p>,<p><strong><em>Machine operators and tenders</em></strong> monitor the machinery during operation.</p>,<p>After a setter prepares a machine for production, an operator observes the machine and the products it makes. Operators may have to load the machine with materials for production or adjust the machine’s speeds during production. They must periodically inspect the parts a machine produces. If they detect a minor problem, operators may fix it themselves. If the repair is more serious, they may have an <a href="/ooh/installation-maintenance-and-repair/industrial-machinery-mechanics-and-maintenance-workers-and-millwrights.htm">industrial machinery mechanic</a> fix it.</p>,<p>Setters, operators, and tenders are usually identified by the type of machine they work with. Job duties generally vary with the size of the manufacturer and the type of machine being operated. Although some workers specialize in one or two types of machinery, many are trained to set up or operate a variety of machines. Machine operators are often able to control multiple machines at the same time because of increased automation.</p>,<p>In addition, production techniques, such as team-oriented “lean” manufacturing, require machine operators to rotate between different machines. Rotating assignments results in more varied work but also requires workers to have a wide range of skills.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of metal and plastic machine workers:</p>,<p><strong><em>Computer-controlled machine tool operators</em></strong> operate computer-controlled machines or robots to perform functions on metal or plastic workpieces.</p>,<p><strong><em>Computer numerically controlled machine tool programmers</em></strong> develop computer programs to control the machining or processing of metal or plastic parts by automatic machine tools, equipment, or systems.</p>,<p><strong><em>Extruding and drawing machine setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate machines to extrude (pull out) thermoplastic or metal materials in the form of tubes, rods, hoses, wire, bars, or structural shapes.</p>,<p><strong><em>Forging machine setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate machines that shape or form metal or plastic parts.</p>,<p><strong><em>Rolling machine setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate machines to roll steel or plastic or to flatten, temper, or reduce the thickness of materials.</p>,<p><strong><em>Cutting, punching, and press machine setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate machines to saw, cut, shear, notch, bend, or straighten metal or plastic materials.</p>,<p><strong><em>Drilling and boring machine tool setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate drilling machines to drill, bore, mill, or countersink metal or plastic workpieces.</p>,<p><strong><em>Grinding, lapping, polishing, and buffing machine tool setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate grinding and related tools that remove excess material from surfaces, sharpen edges or corners, or buff or polish metal or plastic workpieces.</p>,<p><strong><em>Lathe and turning machine tool setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate lathe and turning machines to turn, bore, thread, or form metal or plastic materials, such as wire or rod.</p>,<p><strong><em>Milling and planing machine setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate milling or planing machines to shape, groove, or profile metal or plastic workpieces.</p>,<p><strong><em>Metal-refining furnace operators and tenders</em></strong> operate or tend furnaces, such as gas, oil, coal, electric-arc or electric-induction, open-hearth, and oxygen furnaces.
