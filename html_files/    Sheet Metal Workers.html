<b>Job Title:			</b>     Sheet Metal Workers<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Sheet metal workers fabricate or install products that are made from thin metal sheets, such as ducts used in heating and air conditioning systems.</p>,<p>Sheet metal workers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Sheet metal is thin steel, aluminum, or other alloyed metal that is used in both manufacturing and construction. Sheet metal is commonly used to make ducts for heating and air conditioning systems, but it is also used to make products such as rain gutters, outdoor signs, and siding.</p>,<p>In addition to installing sheet metal, some workers install nonmetallic materials such as fiberglass and plastic board.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of sheet metal workers:</p>,<p><strong><em>Fabrication sheet metal workers</em></strong>, sometimes called <em>precision sheet metal workers</em>, make precision sheet metal parts for a variety of industries, from power generation to medical device manufacturing. Most work in shops and factories, operating tools and equipment. In large-scale manufacturing, the work may be highly automated and repetitive. Many fabrication shops have automated machinery, such as computer-controlled saws, lasers, shears, and presses, which measure, cut, bend, and fasten pieces of sheet metal. Workers often use computer-aided drafting and design (CADD) and building information modeling (BIM) systems to make products. Some of these workers may be responsible for limited programming of the computers controlling their equipment. Workers who primarily program computerized equipment are called <a href="/ooh/production/metal-and-plastic-machine-workers.htm"><u>metal and plastic machine workers</u></a>.</p>,<p><strong><em>Installation sheet metal workers</em></strong> install heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) ducts. They also install other sheet metal products, such as metal roofs, siding, and gutters. They typically work on new construction and on renovation projects. Information about workers who install or repair roofing systems can be found in the profile on <a href="/ooh/construction-and-extraction/roofers.htm"><u>roofers</u></a>.</p>,<p><strong><em>Maintenance sheet metal workers</em></strong> repair and clean ventilation systems so the systems use less energy. Workers remove dust and moisture and fix leaks or breaks in the sheet metal that makes up the ductwork.</p>,<p><strong><em>Testing and balancing sheet metal specialists</em></strong> ensure that HVAC systems heat and cool rooms properly by adjusting sheet metal ducts to achieve proper airflow.
