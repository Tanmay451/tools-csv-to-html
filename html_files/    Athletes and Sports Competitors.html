<b>Job Title:			</b>     Athletes and Sports Competitors<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Athletes and sports competitors participate in organized, officiated sporting events to entertain spectators.</p>,<p>Athletes and sports competitors typically do the following:</p>,<p>Many people dream of becoming a paid professional athlete. Few people, however, beat the odds and make a full-time living from professional athletics—and when they do, professional athletes often have short careers with little job security.</p>,<p>When playing a game, athletes and sports competitors must understand the strategies involved while following the rules and regulations of the sport. The events in which athletes compete include team sports, such as baseball, softball, hockey, and soccer, and individual sports, such as golf, tennis, swimming, and skiing. The level of play varies greatly. Some athletes may compete in regional competitions, while other athletes compete in national or international events.</p>,<p>Being an athlete involves more than competing in athletic events. Athletes spend most days practicing their skills and improving teamwork under the guidance of a <a href="/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/coaches-and-scouts.htm"><u>coach</u></a> or a sports instructor. They review videotapes to critique and improve their own performance and technique. Athletes also must study their opponents' tendencies and weaknesses so as to gain a competitive advantage.</p>,<p>Some athletes work regularly with <a href="/ooh/personal-care-and-service/fitness-trainers-and-instructors.htm"><u>fitness trainers and instructors</u></a> to gain muscle and stamina and to prevent injury. Because of the physical demands required by many sports, career-ending injuries are always a risk. Even minor injuries may put a player at risk of replacement.</p>,<p>Because competition at all levels is extremely intense and job security is always in question, many athletes train throughout the year to maintain or improve their form and technique and remain in peak physical condition. Very little downtime from the sport exists at the professional level.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     No formal educational credential<br><b> job:		</b><li>Practice to develop and improve their skills</li>,<li>Maintain their sports equipment in good condition</li>,<li>Train, exercise, and follow special diets to stay in the best physical condition</li>,<li>Take instructions regarding strategy and tactics from coaches and other sports staff during games</li>,<li>Follow the rules of the sport during competitions and games</li>,<li>Assess their individual and team performance after each event and identify their strengths and weaknesses</li>
