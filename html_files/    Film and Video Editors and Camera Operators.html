<b>Job Title:			</b>     Film and Video Editors and Camera Operators<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Film and video editors and camera operators manipulate images that entertain or inform an audience. Camera operators capture a wide range of material for TV shows, movies, and other media. Editors arrange footage shot by camera operators and collaborate with <a href="/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/producers-and-directors.htm"><u>producers and directors</u></a> to create the final content.</p>,<p>Film and video editors and camera operators typically do the following:</p>,<p>Many camera operators supervise one or more assistants. The assistants set up the camera equipment and may be responsible for its storage and care. Assistants also help the operator determine the best shooting angle and make sure that the camera stays in focus.</p>,<p>Likewise, editors often have one or more assistants. The assistants support the editor by keeping track of each shot in a database or loading digital video into an editing bay. Assistants also may do some of the editing tasks.</p>,<p>Most operators prefer using digital cameras because the smaller, more inexpensive instruments give them more flexibility in shooting angles. Digital cameras also have changed the job of some camera assistants: Instead of loading film or choosing lenses, they download digital images or choose a type of software program to use with the camera. In addition, drone cameras give operators an opportunity to film in the air, or in places that are hard to reach.</p>,<p>Nearly all editing work is done on a computer, and editors often are trained in a specific type of editing software.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of camera operators:</p>,<p><strong><em>Cinematographers</em></strong> film motion pictures. They usually work with a team of camera operators and assistants. Cinematographers determine the angles and types of equipment that will best capture a shot. They also adjust the lighting in a shot, because that is an important part of how the image looks.</p>,<p>Cinematographers may use stationary cameras that shoot whatever passes in front of them, or they may use a camera mounted on a track and move around the action. Some cinematographers sit on cranes to film an action scene; others carry the camera on their shoulder while they move around the action.</p>,<p>Some cinematographers specialize in filming cartoons or special effects.

There may be one or several cameras in use at a time. Operators normally follow directions that give the order of the shots. They often have time to practice camera movements before shooting begins. If they are shooting a live event, they must be able to make adjustments at a moment’s notice and follow the instructions of the show’s director. The use of robotic cameras is common among studio camera operators, and one operator may control several cameras at once.</p>,<p><strong><em>Videographers</em></strong> film or videotape private ceremonies or special events, such as weddings. They also may work with companies and make corporate documentaries on a variety of topics. Most videographers edit their own material.</p>,<p>Many videographers run their own business or do freelance work. They may submit bids, write contracts, and get permission to shoot on locations that may not be open to the public. They also get copyright protection for their work and keep financial records.</p>,<p>Many editors and camera operators, but particularly videographers, put their creative work online. If it becomes popular, they gain more recognition, which can lead to future employment or freelance opportunities.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     Bachelor's degree<br><b> job:		</b><li>Shoot and record television programs, motion pictures, music videos, documentaries, or news and sporting events</li>,<li>Organize digital footage with video-editing software</li>,<li>Collaborate with a director to determine the overall vision of the production</li>,<li>Discuss filming and editing techniques with a director to improve a scene</li>,<li>Select the appropriate equipment, such as the type of lens or lighting</li>,<li>Shoot or edit a scene based on the director’s vision</li>
