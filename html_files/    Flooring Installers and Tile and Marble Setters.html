<b>Job Title:			</b>     Flooring Installers and Tile and Marble Setters<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Flooring installers and tile and marble setters lay and finish carpet, wood, vinyl, and tile.</p>,<p>Flooring installers and tile and marble setters typically do the following:</p>,<p>Nearly every building has a finished floor, and flooring installers and tile and marble setters lay the materials that improve the look and feel of homes, offices, restaurants, and other buildings. Although most of the materials installed by these workers cover only floors, some materials are also installed on walls and countertops or in showers.</p>,<p>A smooth, even base of mortar or plywood is required for floors and tile to be installed. The base may be installed by flooring installers and tile and marble setters or by other construction craftworkers. When remodeling, workers may need to remove the old flooring and smooth the surface.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of flooring installers and tile and marble setters:</p>,<p><strong><em>Carpet installers</em></strong> lay lengths of carpet on new floors or over older flooring. They use special tools, including “knee kickers” to position the carpet and power stretchers to pull the carpet snugly against walls. Installers also join edges of carpet and seam edges where necessary, by sewing or by using tape with glue and a heated carpet iron.</p>,<p><strong><em>Carpet tile installers </em></strong>lay small, modular pieces of carpet that may be glued into place. Carpet tiles allow for easy replacement and design patterns that are not possible with standard carpet.</p>,<p><strong><em>Floor sanders and finishers</em></strong> perform the final steps in hardwood floor installation. After <a href="/ooh/construction-and-extraction/carpenters.htm"><u>carpenters</u></a> install the hardwood floor, workers use power sanders to smooth it. They apply stains and sealants to preserve the wood.</p>,<p><strong><em>Floor layers, except carpet, wood, and hard tiles,</em></strong> install a wide variety of resilient flooring materials. <strong><em>Linoleum installers</em></strong> lay the hard, washable floor material of the same name. The linoleum is cut to size and glued into place. <strong><em>Vinyl installers</em></strong> install plastic-based flooring that includes vinyl ester, vinyl sheeting, and vinyl tile. Installers of laminate, manufactured wood, and wood tile floors are included in this category.</p>,<p><strong><em>Tile and marble setters</em></strong> install ceramic and marble tile. <strong><em>Tile installers</em></strong>, sometimes called <strong><em>tile setters,</em></strong> cut and place tile. To cut tiles, workers use wet saws, tile scribes, or handheld tile cutters to create even edges. They use trowels of different sizes to spread mortar or a sticky paste, called mastic, evenly on the surface to be tiled. To minimize imperfections and keep rows even, they put spacers between tiles. Spacers keep tiles the same distance from each other until the mortar is dry. <strong><em>Tile finishers</em></strong> apply grout between tiles after the tiles are set, using a rubber trowel called a float. When the grout dries, they must wipe the tiles for a clean, finished look. <strong><em>Marble setters</em></strong> cut marble to a specified size with a wet saw. After fastening the stone, marble setters polish the marble to a high luster, using hand or power sanders.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     No formal educational credential<br><b> job:		</b><li>Remove existing flooring or wall covering</li>,<li>Clean and level the surface to be covered</li>,<li>Measure the area and cut flooring material to fit</li>,<li>Arrange flooring according to design plans</li>,<li>Place flooring, using adhesives, nails, or staples</li>,<li>Fill joints with filler compound and remove excess compound</li>,<li>Trim excess carpet or linoleum</li>,<li>Apply necessary finishes, such as sealants and stains</li>
