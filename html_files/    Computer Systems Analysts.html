<b>Job Title:			</b>     Computer Systems Analysts<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Computer systems analysts, sometimes called <em>systems architects</em>, study an organization’s current computer systems and procedures, and design solutions to help the organization operate more efficiently and effectively. They bring business and information technology (IT) together by understanding the needs and limitations of both.</p>,<p>Computer systems analysts typically do the following:</p>,<p>Most computer systems analysts specialize in computer systems that are specific to the organization they work with. For example, an analyst might work predominantly with financial computer systems or with engineering computer systems. Computer systems analysts help other IT team members understand how computer systems can best serve an organization by working closely with the organization’s business leaders.</p>,<p>Computer systems analysts use a variety of techniques, such as data modeling, to design computer systems. Data modeling allows analysts to view processes and data flows. Analysts conduct indepth tests and analyze information and trends in the data to increase a system’s performance and efficiency.</p>,<p>Analysts calculate requirements for how much memory, storage, and computing power the computer system needs. They prepare flowcharts or other kinds of diagrams for programmers or engineers to use when building the system. Analysts also work with these people to solve problems that arise after the initial system is set up. Most analysts do some programming in the course of their work.</p>,<p>In some cases, analysts who supervise the initial installation or upgrade of IT systems from start to finish may be called IT project managers. They monitor a project’s progress to ensure that deadlines, standards, and cost targets are met. IT project managers who also plan and direct an organization’s IT department or IT policies are included in the profile on <a href="/ooh/management/computer-and-information-systems-managers.htm"><u>computer and information systems managers</u></a>.</p>,<p>Many computer systems analysts are general-purpose analysts who develop new systems or fine-tune existing ones; however, there are some specialized systems analysts. The following are examples of types of computer systems analysts:</p>,<p><strong><em>Software quality assurance (QA) analysts</em></strong> do indepth testing and diagnose problems of the systems they design. Testing and diagnosis are done in order to make sure that critical requirements are met. QA analysts also write reports to management recommending ways to improve the systems.</p>,<p><strong><em>Programmer analysts</em></strong> design and update their system’s software and create applications tailored to their organization’s needs. They do more coding and debugging than other types of analysts, although they still work extensively with management and business analysts to determine the business needs that the applications are meant to address. Other occupations that do programming are <a href="/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm"><u>computer programmers</u></a> and <a href="/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm"><u>software developers</u></a>.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     Bachelor's degree<br><b> job:		</b><li>Consult with managers to determine the role of IT systems in an organization</li>,<li>Research emerging technologies to decide if installing them can increase the organization’s efficiency and effectiveness</li>,<li>Prepare an analysis of costs and benefits so that management can decide if IT systems and computing infrastructure upgrades are financially worthwhile</li>,<li>Devise ways to add new functionality to existing computer systems</li>,<li>Design and implement new systems by choosing and configuring hardware and software</li>,<li>Oversee the installation and configuration of new systems to customize them for the organization</li>,<li>Conduct testing to ensure that the systems work as expected</li>,<li>Train the systems’ end users and write instruction manuals</li>
