They hold private, confidential hearings, which are less formal than a court trial.</p>,<p><strong><em>Arbitrators</em></strong> are usually <a href="/ooh/legal/lawyers.htm"><u>attorneys</u></a>, business professionals, or retired <a href="/ooh/legal/judges-and-hearing-officers.htm"><u>judges</u></a> with expertise in a particular field.

When it is not required, the parties in dispute sometimes voluntarily agree to arbitration rather than proceed with litigation or a trial. In some cases, parties may appeal the arbitrator’s decision.</p>,<p><strong><em>Mediators</em></strong> are neutral parties who help people resolve their disputes. However, unlike arbitrators, they do not render binding decisions. Rather, mediators help facilitate discussion and guide the parties toward a mutually acceptable agreement. If the opposing sides cannot reach a settlement with the mediator’s help, they are free to pursue other options.</p>,<p><strong><em>Conciliators</em></strong> are similar to mediators. Although their role is to help guide opposing sides to a settlement, they typically meet with the parties separately. The opposing sides must decide in advance if they will be bound by the conciliator’s recommendations.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     Bachelor's degree<br><b> job:		</b><li>Facilitate communication between disputants to guide parties toward mutual agreement</li>,<li>Clarify issues, concerns, needs, and interests of all parties involved</li>,<li>Conduct initial meetings with disputants to outline the arbitration process</li>,<li>Settle procedural matters such as fees, or determine details such as witness numbers and time requirements</li>,<li>Set up appointments for parties to meet for mediation or arbitration</li>,<li>Interview claimants, agents, or witnesses to obtain information about disputed issues</li>,<li>Prepare settlement agreements for disputants to sign</li>,<li>Apply relevant laws, regulations, policies, or precedents to reach conclusions</li>,<li>Evaluate information from documents such as claim applications, birth or death certificates, and physician or employer records</li>
