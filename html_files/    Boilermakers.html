<b>Job Title:			</b>     Boilermakers<br><b> Discription:			</b><p>Boilermakers assemble, install, maintain, and repair boilers, closed vats, and other large vessels or containers that hold liquids and gases.</p>,<p>Boilermakers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Boilers, tanks, and vats are used in many buildings, factories, and ships. Boilers heat water or other fluids under extreme pressure to generate electric power and to provide heat. Large tanks and vats are used to process and store chemicals, oil, beer, and hundreds of other products.</p>,<p>Boilers are made out of steel, iron, copper, or stainless steel. Manufacturers are increasingly automating the production of boilers to improve the quality of these vessels. However, boilermakers still use many tools to assemble and maintain boilers. For example, they often use hand and power tools and flame-cutting torches to align, cut, and shape pieces for a boiler. Boilermakers also use plumb bobs, levels, wedges, and turnbuckles to align pieces accurately.</p>,<p>During a boiler installation, boilermakers first line up boilerplates and parts, and then use metalworking machinery and other tools to remove irregular edges so that the parts fit together properly. If the plate sections are very large, boilermakers signal crane operators to lift the parts into place. Boilermakers then join the parts by bolting, welding, and riveting them together.</p>,<p>Boilermakers may help erect and repair air pollution abatement equipment, blast furnaces, water treatment plants, storage and process tanks, and smokestacks. Boilermakers also install refractory brick and other heat-resistant materials in fireboxes or pressure vessels. Some install and maintain the huge pipes used in dams to send water to and from hydroelectric power generation turbines.</p>,<p>Boilers last a long time—sometimes 50 years or more—and boilermakers must maintain them regularly by repairing and replacing parts. They inspect fittings, feed pumps, safety and check valves, water and pressure gauges, and boiler controls.</p><br> <b>minimumQualifications:		</b>     High school diploma or equivalent<br><b> job:		</b><li>Read blueprints to determine locations, positions, and dimensions of boiler parts</li>,<li>Install small premade boilers in buildings and manufacturing facilities</li>,<li>Lay out prefabricated parts of larger boilers before assembling them</li>,<li>Assemble boiler tanks, often using robotic or automatic welders</li>,<li>Test and inspect boiler systems for leaks or defects</li>,<li>Clean vats with scrapers, wire brushes, and cleaning solvents</li>,<li>Replace or repair broken valves, pipes, or joints, using hand and power tools, gas torches, and welding equipment</li>
