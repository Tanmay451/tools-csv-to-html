Agents spend much of the day interacting with people, whether selling stock to an individual or discussing the status of a merger deal with a company executive. The work is usually stressful because agents deal with large amounts of money and have time constraints.</p>,<p>A security or commodity can be traded in two ways: electronically or in an auction-style setting on the floor of an exchange market. Markets such as the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (NASDAQ) use vast computer networks rather than human traders to match buyers and sellers. Others, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), rely on floor brokers to complete transactions.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of securities, commodities, and financial services sales agents:</p>,<p><strong><em>Brokers</em></strong> sell securities and commodities directly to individual clients. They advise people on appropriate investments based on the client’s needs and financial ability. The people they advise may have very different levels of expertise in financial matters.</p>,<p>Finding clients is a large part of a broker’s job. They must create their own client base by calling from a list of potential clients. Some agents network by joining social groups, and others may rely on referrals from satisfied clients.</p>,<p><strong><em>Investment bankers</em></strong> connect businesses that need money to finance their operations or expansion plans with investors who are interested in providing that funding. This process is called underwriting, and it is the main function of investment banks. The banks first sell their advisory services to help companies issue new stocks or bonds, and then the banks sell the issued securities to investors.</p>,<p>Some of the most important services that investment bankers provide are initial public offerings (IPOs), and mergers and acquisitions. An IPO is the process by which a company becomes open for public investment by issuing its first stock. Investment bankers must estimate how much the company is worth and ensure that it meets the legal requirements to become publicly traded.</p>,<p>Investment bankers also connect companies in mergers (when two companies join together) and acquisitions (when one company buys another). Investment bankers provide advice throughout the process to ensure that the transaction goes smoothly.</p>,<p><strong><em>Investment banking sales agents and traders</em></strong> carry out buy and sell orders for stocks, bonds, and commodities from clients and make trades on behalf of the firm itself. Investment banks primarily employ these workers, although some work for commercial banks, hedge funds, and private equity groups. Because markets fluctuate so much, trading is a split-second decisionmaking process. Slight changes in the price of a trade can greatly affect its profitability, making the trader’s decision extremely important.</p>,<p><strong><em>Floor brokers</em></strong> work directly on the floor—a large room where trading is done—of a securities or commodities exchange. After a trader places an order for a security, floor brokers negotiate the price, make the sale, and forward the purchase price to the trader.</p>,<p><strong><em>Financial services sales agents</em></strong> consult on a wide variety of banking, securities, insurance, and related services to individuals and businesses, often catering the services to meet the client’s financial needs.

In large libraries, they usually focus on one aspect of the library, such as user services, technical services, or administrative services.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of librarians:</p>,<p><strong><em>Academic librarians</em></strong> assist students, faculty, and staff in postsecondary institutions. They help students research topics related to their coursework and teach students how to access information. They also assist faculty and staff in locating resources related to their research projects or studies. Some campuses have multiple libraries, and librarians may specialize in a particular subject.</p>,<p><strong><em>Administrative services librarians</em></strong> manage libraries, prepare budgets, and negotiate contracts for library materials and equipment. Some conduct public relations or fundraising activities for the library.</p>,<p><strong><em>Public librarians</em></strong> work in their communities to serve all members of the public. They help patrons find books to read for pleasure; conduct research for schoolwork, business, or personal interest; and learn how to access the library’s resources. Many public librarians plan programs for patrons, such as story time for children, book clubs, or educational activities.</p>,<p><strong><em>School librarians</em></strong>, sometimes called <em>school media specialists</em>, work in elementary, middle, and high school libraries and teach students how to use library resources. They also help teachers develop lesson plans and find materials for classroom instruction.</p>,<p><strong><em>Special librarians</em></strong> work in settings other than school or public libraries. They are sometimes called <em>information professionals</em>. Businesses, museums, government agencies, and many other groups have their own libraries that use special librarians. The main purpose of these libraries and information centers is to serve the information needs of the organization that houses the library. Therefore, special librarians collect and organize materials focused on those subjects. Special librarians may need an additional degree in the subject that they specialize in. The following are examples of special librarians:</p>,<p><strong><em>Technical services librarians</em></strong> obtain, prepare, and organize print and electronic library materials. They arrange materials for patrons’ ease in finding information. They are also responsible for ordering new library materials and archiving to preserve older items.</p>,<p><strong><em>User services librarians</em></strong> help patrons conduct research using both electronic and print resources. They teach patrons how to use library resources to find information on their own. This may include familiarizing patrons with catalogs of print materials, helping them access and search digital libraries, or educating them on Internet search techniques.

"<p>Actuaries analyze the financial costs of risk and uncertainty. They use mathematics, statistics, and financial theory to assess the risk of potential events, and they help businesses and clients develop policies that minimize the cost of that risk. Actuaries’ work is essential to the insurance industry.</p>,<p>Actuaries typically do the following:</p>,<p>Most actuarial work is done with computers. Actuaries use database software to compile information. They use advanced statistics and modeling software to forecast the probability of an event occurring, the potential costs of the event if it does occur, and whether the insurance company has enough money to pay future claims.</p>,<p>Actuaries typically work on teams that often include managers and professionals in other fields, such as accounting, underwriting, and finance. For example, some actuaries work with <a href=""/ooh/business-and-financial/accountants-and-auditors.htm""><u>accountants</u></a> and <a href=""/ooh/business-and-financial/financial-analysts.htm""><u>financial analysts</u></a> to set the price for security offerings or with <a href=""/ooh/business-and-financial/market-research-analysts.htm""><u>market research analysts</u></a> to forecast demand for new products.</p>,<p>Most actuaries work at insurance companies, where they help design policies and determine the premiums that should be charged for each policy. They must ensure that the premiums are profitable yet competitive with other insurance companies.</p>,<p>Actuaries in the insurance industry typically specialize in a specific field of insurance, such as one of the following:</p>,<p><strong><em>Health insurance actuaries</em></strong> help develop long-term care and health insurance policies by predicting expected costs of providing care under the terms of an insurance contract. Their predictions are based on numerous factors, including family history, geographic location, and occupation.</p>,<p><strong><em>Life insurance actuaries</em></strong> help develop annuity and life insurance policies for individuals and groups by estimating, on the basis of risk factors such as age, gender, and tobacco use, how long someone is expected to live.</p>,<p><strong><em>Property and casualty insurance actuaries</em></strong> help develop insurance policies that insure policyholders against property loss and liability resulting from accidents, natural disasters, fires, and other events. They calculate the expected number of claims resulting from automobile accidents, which varies with the insured person’s age, sex, driving history, type of car, and other factors.</p>,<p>Some actuaries apply their expertise to financial matters outside of the insurance industry. For example, they develop investment strategies that manage risks and maximize returns for companies or individuals.</p>,<p><strong><em>Pension and retirement benefits actuaries</em></strong> design, test, and evaluate company pension plans to determine if the expected funds available in the future will be enough to ensure payment of future benefits. They must report the results of their evaluations to the federal government. Pension actuaries also help businesses develop other types of retirement plans, such as 401(k)s and healthcare plans for retirees. In addition, they provide retirement planning advice to individuals.</p>,<p><strong><em>Enterprise risk actuaries</em></strong> identify any risks, including economic, financial, and geopolitical risks that may affect a company’s short-term or long-term objectives. They help top executives determine how much risk the business is willing to take, and they develop strategies to respond to these issues.</p>,<p>Actuaries also work in the public sector. In the federal government, actuaries may evaluate proposed changes to Social Security or Medicare or conduct economic and demographic studies to project future benefit obligations. At the state level, actuaries may examine and regulate the rates charged by insurance companies.</p>,<p>Some actuaries are considered consultants and provide advice to clients on a contract basis.

However, APRNs are trained to perform many additional functions, including ordering and evaluating test results, referring patients to specialists, and diagnosing and treating ailments. APRNs focus on patient-centered care, which means understanding a patient’s concerns and lifestyle before choosing a course of action.</p>,<p>APRNs also may conduct research or teach staff about new policies or procedures. Others may provide consultation services based on a specific field of knowledge, such as oncology, which is the study of cancer.</p>,<p>The following are types of APRNs:</p>,<p><strong><em>Nurse anesthetists (CRNAs)</em></strong> provide anesthesia and related care before, during, and after surgical, therapeutic, diagnostic, and obstetrical procedures. They also provide pain management and some emergency services. Before a procedure begins, nurse anesthetists discuss with a patient any medications the patient is taking as well as any allergies or illnesses the patient may have, so that anesthesia can be safely administered. Nurse anesthetists then give a patient general anesthesia to put the patient to sleep so they feel no pain during surgery or administer a regional or local anesthesia to numb an area of the body. They remain with the patient throughout a procedure to monitor vital signs and adjust the anesthesia as necessary.</p>,<p><strong><em>Nurse midwives (CNMs)</em></strong> provide care to women, including gynecological exams, family planning services, and prenatal care. They deliver babies; manage emergency situations during labor, such as hemorrhaging; repair lacerations; and may provide surgical assistance to physicians during cesarean births. Nurse midwives may act as primary care providers for women and newborns. They also provide wellness care, educating their patients on how to lead healthy lives by discussing topics such as nutrition and disease prevention. Nurse midwives also provide care to their patients’ partners for sexual or reproductive health issues.</p>,<p><strong><em>Nurse practitioners (NPs)</em></strong> serve as primary and specialty care providers, delivering advanced nursing services to patients and their families. They assess patients, determine the best way to improve or manage a patient’s health, and discuss ways to integrate health promotion strategies into a patient’s life.

"<p>Physicians and surgeons diagnose and treat injuries or illnesses. Physicians examine patients; take medical histories; prescribe medications; and order, perform, and interpret diagnostic tests. They often counsel patients on diet, hygiene, and preventive healthcare. Surgeons operate on patients to treat injuries, such as broken bones; diseases, such as cancerous tumors; and deformities, such as cleft palates.</p>,<p>There are two types of physicians, with similar degrees: M.D. (Medical Doctor) and D.O. (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine). Both use the same methods of treatment, including drugs and surgery, but D.O.s place additional emphasis on the body's musculoskeletal system, preventive medicine, and holistic (whole-person) patient care. D.O.s are most likely to be primary care physicians, although they can be found in all specialties.</p>,<p>Physicians and surgeons typically do the following:</p>,<p>Physicians and surgeons work in one or more specialties. The following are examples of types of physicians and surgeons:</p>,<p><strong><em>Anesthesiologists</em></strong> focus on the care of surgical patients and pain relief. They administer drugs (anesthetics) that reduce or eliminate the sensation of pain during an operation or another medical procedure. During surgery, they are responsible for adjusting the amount of anesthetic as needed, and monitoring the patient's heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, and breathing. They also work outside of the operating room, providing pain relief for patients in the intensive care unit, for women in labor and delivery of babies, and for patients who suffer from chronic pain. Anesthesiologists work with other physicians and surgeons to decide on treatments and procedures before, during, and after surgery.</p>,<p><strong><em>Family and general physicians</em></strong> assess and treat a range of conditions that occur in everyday life. These conditions include sinus and respiratory infections to broken bones. Family and general physicians typically have regular, long-term patients.</p>,<p><strong><em>General internists</em></strong> diagnose and provide nonsurgical treatment for a range of problems that affect internal organ systems such as the stomach, kidneys, liver, and digestive tract. Internists use a variety of diagnostic techniques to treat patients through medication or hospitalization. They work mostly with adult patients.</p>,<p><strong><em>General pediatricians</em></strong> provide care for infants, children, teenagers, and young adults. They specialize in diagnosing and treating problems specific to younger people. Most pediatricians treat common illnesses, minor injuries, and infectious diseases, and administer vaccinations. Some pediatricians specialize in pediatric surgery or serious medical conditions that commonly affect younger patients, such as autoimmune disorders or chronic ailments.</p>,<p><strong><em>Obstetricians and gynecologists</em> <em>(OB/GYNs)</em></strong> provide care related to pregnancy, childbirth, and the female reproductive system. They treat and counsel women throughout their pregnancy and deliver babies. They also diagnose and treat health issues specific to women, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, hormonal disorders, and symptoms related to menopause.</p>,<p><strong><em>Psychiatrists</em></strong> are primary mental health physicians. They diagnose and treat mental illnesses through a combination of personal counseling (psychotherapy), psychoanalysis, hospitalization, and medication. Psychotherapy involves regular discussions with patients about their problems. The psychiatrist helps them find solutions through changes in their behavioral patterns, explorations of their past experiences, or group and family therapy sessions. Psychoanalysis involves long-term psychotherapy and counseling for patients. Psychiatrists may prescribe medications to correct chemical imbalances that cause some mental illnesses.</p>,<p><strong><em>Surgeons</em></strong> treat injuries, diseases, and deformities through operations. Using a variety of instruments, a surgeon corrects physical deformities, repairs bone and tissue after injuries, or performs preventive or elective surgeries on patients. Although a large number perform general surgery, many surgeons choose to specialize in a specific area. Specialties include orthopedic surgery (the treatment of the musculoskeletal system), neurological surgery (treatment of the brain and nervous system), cardiovascular surgery, and plastic or reconstructive surgery. Like other physicians, surgeons examine patients, perform and interpret diagnostic tests, and counsel patients on preventive healthcare. Some specialist physicians also perform surgery.</p>,<p>Physicians and surgeons may work in a number of other medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties. The following specialists are some of the most common examples:</p>,<p>Physicians in healthcare establishments work daily with other healthcare staff, such as <u><a href=""/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm"">registered nurses</a></u>, other physicians, <u><a href=""/ooh/healthcare/medical-assistants.htm"">medical assistants</a></u>, and <u><a href=""/ooh/healthcare/medical-records-and-health-information-technicians.htm"">medical records and health information technicians</a></u>.</p>,<p>Some physicians may choose to work in fields that do not involve patient care, such as medical research or public policy. </p>",    Doctoral or professional degree,    Physicians and Surgeons,"<li>Take a patient’s medical history</li>,<li>Update charts and patient information to show current findings and treatments</li>,<li>Order tests for nurses or other healthcare staff to perform</li>,<li>Review test results to identify any abnormal findings</li>,<li>Recommend and design a plan of treatment</li>,<li>Address concerns or answer questions that patients have about their health and well-being</li>,<li>Help patients take care of their health by discussing topics such as proper nutrition and hygiene</li>,<li>Allergists (specialists in diagnosing and treating hay fever or other allergies)</li>,<li>Cardiologists (heart specialists)</li>,<li>Dermatologists (skin specialists)</li>,<li>Gastroenterologists (digestive system specialists)</li>,<li>Ophthalmologists (eye specialists)</li>,<li>Pathologists (specialists who study body tissue to see if it is normal or abnormal)</li>,<li>Radiologists (specialists who review and interpret x rays and other images and deliver radiation treatments for cancer and other illnesses)</li>"
"<p>Registered nurses (RNs) provide and coordinate patient care, educate patients and the public about various health conditions, and provide advice and emotional support to patients and their family members.</p>,<p>Registered nurses typically do the following:</p>,<p>Most registered nurses work as part of a team with <a href=""/ooh/healthcare/physicians-and-surgeons.htm""><u>physicians</u></a> and other healthcare specialists.

For example, an oncology nurse may work with cancer patients or a geriatric nurse may work with elderly patients. Some registered nurses combine one or more areas of practice. For example, a pediatric oncology nurse works with children and teens who have cancer.</p>,<p>Many possibilities for working with specific patient groups exist. The following list includes just a few examples:</p>,<p><strong><em>Addiction nurses</em></strong> care for patients who need help to overcome addictions to alcohol, drugs, and other substances.</p>,<p><strong><em>Cardiovascular nurses</em></strong> care for patients with heart disease and people who have had heart surgery.</p>,<p><strong><em>Critical care nurses</em></strong> work in intensive-care units in hospitals, providing care to patients with serious, complex, and acute illnesses and injuries that need very close monitoring and treatment.</p>,<p><strong><em>Genetics nurses</em></strong> provide screening, counseling, and treatment for patients with genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis.</p>,<p><strong><em>Neonatology nurses</em></strong> take care of newborn babies.</p>,<p><strong><em>Nephrology nurses</em></strong> care for patients who have kidney-related health issues stemming from diabetes, high blood pressure, substance abuse, or other causes.</p>,<p><strong><em>Public health nurses </em></strong>promote public health by educating people on warning signs and symptoms of disease or managing chronic health conditions.

"<p>Claims adjusters, appraisers, examiners, and investigators evaluate insurance claims. They decide whether an insurance company must pay a claim and if so, how much.</p>,<p>Claims adjusters, appraisers, examiners, and investigators typically do the following:</p>,<p>Claims adjusters, appraisers, examiners, and investigators have varying duties, depending on the type of insurance company they work for. They must know a lot about what their company insures. For example, workers in property and casualty insurance must know housing and construction costs in order to properly evaluate damage from floods or fires. Workers in health insurance must be able to determine which types of treatments are medically necessary and which are questionable.</p>,<p><strong><em>Adjusters</em></strong> inspect property damage or personal injury claims to determine how much the insurance company should pay for the loss. They might inspect a home, a business, or an automobile.</p>,<p>Adjusters interview the claimant and witnesses, inspect the property, and do additional research, such as look at police reports. They may consult with other workers, such as accountants, architects, construction workers, engineers, lawyers, and physicians, who can offer a more expert evaluation of a claim.</p>,<p>Adjusters gather information—including photographs and statements, either written or recorded on audio or video—and put together a report for claims examiners to evaluate. When the examiner approves the claim, the adjuster negotiates with the policyholder and settles the claim.</p>,<p>If the claimant contests the outcome of the claim or the settlement, adjusters work with attorneys and expert witnesses to defend the insurer’s position.</p>,<p>Some claims adjusters work as <strong><em>public adjusters</em></strong>. Often, they are hired by claimants who prefer not to rely on the insurance company’s adjuster. The goal of adjusters working for insurance companies is to save as much money for the company as possible. The goal of a public adjuster working for a claimant is to get the highest possible amount paid to the claimant. They are paid a percentage of the settled claim.</p>,<p><strong><em>Appraisers</em></strong> estimate the cost or value of an insured item. Most appraisers who work for insurance companies and independent adjusting firms are <strong><em>auto damage appraisers</em></strong>. They inspect damaged vehicles after an accident and estimate the cost of repairs. This information then goes to the adjuster, who puts the estimated cost of repairs into the settlement.</p>,<p><strong><em>Claims examiners</em></strong> review claims after they are submitted to ensure claimants and adjusters followed proper guidelines. They may assist adjusters with complicated claims or when, for example, a natural disaster occurs and the volume of claims increases.</p>,<p>Examiners who work for health insurance companies review health-related claims to see whether the costs are reasonable, given the diagnosis. After they review the claim, they authorize appropriate payment, deny the claim, or refer the claim to an investigator.</p>,<p>Examiners who work for life insurance companies review the causes of death and pay particular attention to accidents, because most life insurance companies pay additional benefits if a death is accidental. Examiners also may review new applications for life insurance policies to make sure that the applicants have no serious illnesses that would make them a high risk to insure.</p>,<p><strong><em>Insurance investigators</em></strong> handle claims in which the company suspects fraudulent or criminal activity such as arson, staged accidents, or unnecessary medical treatments. The severity of insurance fraud cases varies, from overstated claims of damage to vehicles to complicated fraud rings. Investigators often do surveillance work. For example, in the case of a fraudulent workers’ compensation claim, an investigator may covertly watch the claimant to see if he or she does anything that would be suspicious based on injuries stated in the claim.</p>",    ,"    Claims Adjusters, Appraisers, Examiners, and Investigators","<li>Investigate, evaluate, and settle insurance claims</li>,<li>Determine whether the insurance policy covers the loss claimed</li>,<li>Decide the appropriate amount the insurance company should pay</li>,<li>Ensure that claims are not fraudulent</li>,<li>Contact claimants’ doctors or employers to get additional information on questionable claims</li>,<li>Confer with legal counsel on claims when needed</li>,<li>Negotiate settlements</li>,<li>Authorize payments</li>"

"<p>Advertising sales agents, also called <em>advertising sales representatives</em>, sell advertising space to businesses and individuals. They contact potential clients, make sales presentations, and maintain client accounts.</p>,<p>Advertising sales agents typically do the following:</p>,<p>Advertising sales agents work outside the office occasionally, meeting with clients and prospective clients at their places of business. Some may make telephone sales calls as well—calling prospects, attempting to sell the media firm’s advertising space or time, and arranging followup appointments with interested prospects.</p>,<p>A critical part of building relationships with clients is learning about their needs. Before the first meeting with a client, a sales agent gathers background information on the client’s products, current clients, prospective clients, and the geographic area of the target market.</p>,<p>The sales agent then meets with the client to explain how specific types of advertising will help promote the client’s products or services most effectively. If a client wishes to proceed, the advertising sales agent prepares and presents an advertising proposal to the client. The proposal may include an overview of the advertising medium to be used, sample advertisements, and cost estimates for the project.</p>,<p>Because of consolidation among media industries, agents are increasingly selling several types of ads in one package. For example, agents may sell ads that would be found in print editions, as well as online editions, of a particular publication, such as a newspaper.</p>,<p>In addition to maintaining sales and overseeing their accounts, advertising sales agents analyze sales statistics and prepare reports about clients’ accounts. They keep up to date on industry trends by reading about both current and new products, and they monitor the sales, prices, and products of their competitors.</p>,<p>In many firms, the advertising sales agent drafts contracts, which specify the cost and the advertising work to be done. Agents also may continue to help the client, answering questions or addressing problems the client may have with the proposal.</p>,<p>In addition, sales agents may be responsible for developing sales tools, promotional plans, and media kits, all of which they use to help make a sale.

"<p>Photographers use their technical expertise, creativity, and composition skills to produce and preserve images that tell a story or record an event.</p>,<p>Photographers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Nowadays, most photographers use digital cameras instead of traditional film cameras, although some photographers use both. Digital cameras capture images electronically, so the photographer can edit the image on a computer. Images can be stored on portable memory devices, such as flash drives. Once the raw image has been transferred to a computer, photographers can use image processing software to crop or modify the image and enhance it through color correction and other specialized effects. Photographers who edit their own pictures use computers, editing software, and high-quality printers.</p>,<p>Some photographers use unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, to capture shots. The drones are equipped with an integrated camera to capture 360-degree imagery of buildings, landscapes, scenery, or events.</p>,<p>Photographers who work for commercial clients often present photographs in a digital format to the client. Wedding and portrait photographers, who serve primarily noncommercial clients, also may provide framing services and present the photographs they capture in albums.</p>,<p>Many photographers are self-employed. Photographers who own and operate their own business have additional responsibilities. They must advertise, schedule appointments, set up and adjust equipment, buy supplies, keep records, charge customers, pay bills, and—if they have employees—hire, train, and direct their workers.</p>,<p>In addition, some photographers teach photography classes or conduct workshops in schools or in their own studios.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of photographers:</p>,<p><strong><em>Aerial photographers</em></strong> travel in planes or helicopters to capture overhead photographs of buildings and landscapes.

"<p>Airline and commercial pilots fly and navigate airplanes, helicopters, and other aircraft.</p>,<p>Pilots typically do the following:</p>,<p>Pilots plan their flights by checking that the aircraft is operable and safe, that the cargo has been loaded correctly, and that weather conditions are acceptable. They file flight plans with air traffic control and may modify the plans in flight because of changing weather conditions or other factors.</p>,<p>Takeoff and landing can be the most demanding parts of a flight. They require close coordination among the pilot; copilot; flight engineer, if present; air traffic controllers; and ground personnel. Once in the air, the captain may have the first officer, if present, fly the aircraft, but the captain remains responsible for the aircraft. After landing, pilots fill out records that document their flight and the status of the aircraft.</p>,<p>Some pilots are also instructors using simulators and dual-controlled aircraft to teach students how to fly.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of pilots:</p>,<p><strong><em>Airline pilots</em></strong> work primarily for airlines that transport passengers and cargo on a fixed schedule. The captain or pilot in command, usually the most experienced pilot, supervises all other crew members and has primary responsibility for the flight. The copilot, often called the first officer or second in command, shares flight duties with the captain. Some older planes require a third pilot known as a flight engineer, who monitors instruments and operates controls. Technology has automated many of these tasks, and new aircraft do not require flight engineers.</p>,<p><strong><em>Commercial pilots</em></strong> are involved in unscheduled flight activities, such as aerial application, charter flights, and aerial tours. Commercial pilots may have additional nonflight duties. Some commercial pilots schedule flights, arrange for maintenance of the aircraft, and load luggage themselves. Pilots who transport company executives, also known as corporate pilots, greet their passengers before embarking on the flight.</p>,<p>Agricultural pilots typically handle agricultural chemicals, such as pesticides, and may be involved in other agricultural practices in addition to flying.

Their research has a wide range of applications, including food safety, pharmaceuticals, and pollution control.</p>,<p><strong><em>Forensic chemists</em></strong> analyze evidence for clues to help solve crimes. These chemists aid in criminal investigations by testing evidence, such as DNA, and interpreting their findings. Not only is human DNA evidence tested; DNA evidence can be used to exonerate animals suspected of having killed people or other animals. These chemists work primarily in laboratories, though they sometimes testify in court.</p>,<p><strong><em>Inorganic chemists</em></strong> study the structure, properties, and reactions of molecules that do not contain carbon, such as metals. They work to understand the behavior and the characteristics of inorganic substances. Inorganic chemists figure out how these materials, such as ceramics and superconductors, can be modified, separated, or used in products.</p>,<p><strong><em>Medicinal chemists</em></strong> research and develop chemical compounds that can be used as pharmaceutical drugs.

"<p>Farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural managers operate establishments that produce crops, livestock, and dairy products.</p>,<p>Farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural managers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural managers monitor the constantly changing prices for their products. They use different strategies to protect themselves from unpredictable changes in the markets. For example, some farmers carefully plan the combination of crops that they grow, so if the price of one crop drops, they will have enough income from another crop to make up for the loss. Farmers and ranchers also track disease and weather conditions closely, because disease and bad weather may have a negative impact on crop yields or animal health. When farmers and ranchers plan ahead, they may be able to store their crops or keep their livestock in order to take advantage of higher prices later in the year.</p>,<p>Most farm output goes to food-processing companies. However, some farmers now choose to sell a portion of their goods directly to consumers through farmer’s markets or use cooperatives to reduce their financial risk and to gain a larger share of the final price of their goods. In community-supported agriculture (CSA), cooperatives sell shares of a harvest to consumers before the planting season in order to ensure a market for the farm’s produce.</p>,<p>Farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural managers also negotiate with banks and other credit lenders to get financing, because they must buy seed, livestock, and equipment before they have products to sell.</p>,<p><strong><em>Farmers and ranchers</em></strong> own and operate mainly family-owned farms. They also may lease land from a landowner and operate it as a working farm.</p>,<p>The size of the farm or range determines which tasks farmers and ranchers handle. Those who operate small farms or ranges may do all tasks, including harvesting and inspecting the land, growing crops, and raising animals. In addition, they keep records, service machinery, and maintain buildings.</p>,<p>By contrast, farmers and ranchers who operate larger farms generally have employees—including <a href=""/ooh/farming-fishing-and-forestry/agricultural-workers.htm""><u>agricultural workers</u></a>—who help with physical work. Some employees of large farms are in nonfarm occupations, working as truck drivers, sales representatives, bookkeepers, or information technology specialists.</p>,<p>Farmers and ranchers track technological improvements in animal breeding and seeds, choosing new products that might increase output. Many livestock and dairy farmers monitor and attend to the health of their herds, which may include assisting in births.</p>,<p><strong><em>Agricultural managers</em></strong> take care of the day-to-day operations of one or more farms, ranches, nurseries, timber tracts, greenhouses, and other agricultural establishments for corporations, farmers, and owners who do not live and work on their farm or ranch.</p>,<p>Agricultural managers usually do not participate in production activities themselves.

Modern manufacturing systems use robots, computers, programmable motion-control devices, and various sensing technologies. These technological changes affect the way in which goods are made and the jobs of those who make them. Advanced assemblers must be able to work with these new technologies and use them to manufacture goods.</p>,<p>The job of an assembler or fabricator requires a range of knowledge and skills. Skilled assemblers putting together complex machines, for example, read detailed schematics that show how to assemble the machine. After determining how parts should connect, they use hand or power tools to trim, shim, cut, and make other adjustments to fit components together. Once the parts are properly aligned, they connect them with bolts and screws, or they weld or solder pieces together.</p>,<p>Quality control is important throughout the assembly process, so assemblers look for faulty components and mistakes in the assembly process. They help fix problems before defective products are made.</p>,<p>Manufacturing techniques are moving away from traditional assembly line systems toward lean manufacturing systems, which use teams of workers to produce entire products or components. Lean manufacturing has changed the nature of the assemblers’ duties.</p>,<p>It has become more common to involve assemblers and fabricators in product development. Designers and engineers consult manufacturing workers during the design stage to improve product reliability and manufacturing efficiency.

Many workers, however, perform both tasks.</p>,<p>Although many workers both set up and operate machines, some may specialize in being a machine setter or a machine operator and tender.</p>,<p><strong><em>Machine setters</em></strong>, or setup workers, prepare the machines before production, perform test runs, and, if necessary, adjust and make minor repairs to the machinery before and during operation.</p>,<p>If, for example, the cutting tool inside a machine becomes dull after extended use, it is common for a setter to remove the tool, use a grinder or file to sharpen it, and reinstall it into the machine. New tools are produced by <a href=""/ooh/production/machinists-and-tool-and-die-makers.htm"">tool and die makers</a>.</p>,<p>After installing the tools into a machine, setup workers often produce the initial batch of goods, inspect the products, and turn the machine over to an operator.</p>,<p><strong><em>Machine operators and tenders</em></strong> monitor the machinery during operation.</p>,<p>After a setter prepares a machine for production, an operator observes the machine and the products it makes. Operators may have to load the machine with materials for production or adjust the machine’s speeds during production. They must periodically inspect the parts a machine produces. If they detect a minor problem, operators may fix it themselves. If the repair is more serious, they may have an <a href=""/ooh/installation-maintenance-and-repair/industrial-machinery-mechanics-and-maintenance-workers-and-millwrights.htm"">industrial machinery mechanic</a> fix it.</p>,<p>Setters, operators, and tenders are usually identified by the type of machine they work with. Job duties generally vary with the size of the manufacturer and the type of machine being operated. Although some workers specialize in one or two types of machinery, many are trained to set up or operate a variety of machines. Machine operators are often able to control multiple machines at the same time because of increased automation.</p>,<p>In addition, production techniques, such as team-oriented “lean” manufacturing, require machine operators to rotate between different machines. Rotating assignments results in more varied work but also requires workers to have a wide range of skills.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of metal and plastic machine workers:</p>,<p><strong><em>Computer-controlled machine tool operators</em></strong> operate computer-controlled machines or robots to perform functions on metal or plastic workpieces.</p>,<p><strong><em>Computer numerically controlled machine tool programmers</em></strong> develop computer programs to control the machining or processing of metal or plastic parts by automatic machine tools, equipment, or systems.</p>,<p><strong><em>Extruding and drawing machine setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate machines to extrude (pull out) thermoplastic or metal materials in the form of tubes, rods, hoses, wire, bars, or structural shapes.</p>,<p><strong><em>Forging machine setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate machines that shape or form metal or plastic parts.</p>,<p><strong><em>Rolling machine setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate machines to roll steel or plastic or to flatten, temper, or reduce the thickness of materials.</p>,<p><strong><em>Cutting, punching, and press machine setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate machines to saw, cut, shear, notch, bend, or straighten metal or plastic materials.</p>,<p><strong><em>Drilling and boring machine tool setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate drilling machines to drill, bore, mill, or countersink metal or plastic workpieces.</p>,<p><strong><em>Grinding, lapping, polishing, and buffing machine tool setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate grinding and related tools that remove excess material from surfaces, sharpen edges or corners, or buff or polish metal or plastic workpieces.</p>,<p><strong><em>Lathe and turning machine tool setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate lathe and turning machines to turn, bore, thread, or form metal or plastic materials, such as wire or rod.</p>,<p><strong><em>Milling and planing machine setters, operators, and tenders</em></strong> set up or operate milling or planing machines to shape, groove, or profile metal or plastic workpieces.</p>,<p><strong><em>Metal-refining furnace operators and tenders</em></strong> operate or tend furnaces, such as gas, oil, coal, electric-arc or electric-induction, open-hearth, and oxygen furnaces.

When equipment breaks down, mechanics use many strategies to diagnose the source and extent of the problem. Small engine mechanics identify mechanical, electrical, and fuel system problems and make necessary repairs.</p>,<p>Mechanics’ tasks vary in complexity and difficulty. Maintenance inspections and repairs, for example, involve minor adjustments or the replacement of a single part. Hand calibration, piston calibration, and spark plug replacement, however, may require taking an engine apart completely. Some mechanics use computerized equipment to tune racing motorcycles and motorboats.</p>,<p>Mechanics use a variety of hand tools, including screwdrivers, wrenches, and pliers, for many common tasks. Some mechanics also may use compression gauges, ammeters, and voltmeters to test engine performance. For more complicated procedures, they commonly use pneumatic tools, which are powered by compressed air, or diagnostic equipment.</p>,<p>Although employers usually provide the more expensive tools and testing equipment, some mechanics may be required to use their own hand tools.

As impartial third parties, they hear and decide disputes between opposing parties. Arbitrators may work alone or in a panel with other arbitrators. In some cases, arbitrators may decide procedural issues, such as what evidence may be submitted and when hearings will be held.</p>,<p>Arbitration may be required by law for some claims and disputes. When it is not required, the parties in dispute sometimes voluntarily agree to arbitration rather than proceed with litigation or a trial. In some cases, parties may appeal the arbitrator’s decision.</p>,<p><strong><em>Mediators</em></strong> are neutral parties who help people resolve their disputes.

"<p>Welders, cutters, solderers, and brazers use hand-held or remotely controlled equipment to join or cut metal parts. They also fill holes, indentations, or seams in metal products.</p>,<p>Welders, cutters, solderers, and brazers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Welding is the most common way of permanently joining metal parts. In this process, heat is applied to metal pieces, melting and fusing them to form a permanent bond. Because of its strength, welding is used in shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing and repair, aerospace applications, and thousands of other manufacturing activities. Welding also is used to join steel beams in the construction of buildings, bridges, and other structures and to join pipes in pipelines, power plants, and refineries.</p>,<p><strong><em>Welders</em></strong> work in a wide variety of industries, from car racing to manufacturing. The work that welders do and the equipment they use vary with the industry. Arc welding, the most common type of welding today, uses electrical currents to create heat and bond metals together—but there are more than 100 different processes that a welder can use. The type of weld is usually determined by the types of metals being joined and the conditions under which the welding is to take place.</p>,<p><strong><em>Cutters</em></strong> use heat to cut and trim metal objects to specific dimensions. Their work is closely related to that of welders. However, instead of joining metals, cutters use the heat from an electric arc, a stream of ionized gas called plasma, or burning gases to cut and trim metal objects to specific dimensions. Cutters also dismantle large objects, such as ships, railroad cars, automobiles, buildings, and aircraft. Some operate and monitor cutting machines similar to those used by welding machine operators.</p>,<p><strong><em>Solderers</em></strong> and <strong><em>brazers</em></strong> also use heat to join two or more metal objects together. Soldering and brazing are similar, except that the temperature used to melt the filler metal is lower in soldering. Soldering uses metals with a melting point below 840 degrees Fahrenheit. Brazing uses metals with a higher melting point.</p>,<p>Soldering and brazing workers use molten metal to join two pieces of metal. However, the metal added during the soldering or brazing process has a melting point lower than that of the piece, so only the added metal is melted, not the piece. Therefore, these processes normally do not create distortions or weaknesses in the piece, as can occur with welding.</p>,<p>Soldering commonly is used to make electrical and electronic circuit boards, such as computer chips. Soldering workers tend to work with small pieces that must be positioned precisely.</p>,<p>Brazing often is used to connect cast iron and thinner metals that the higher temperatures of welding would warp.

They dispense medications to patients and answer any questions that patients may have about prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, or any health concerns that the patient may have. They also may provide some primary care services such as giving flu shots.</p>,<p><strong><em>Clinical pharmacists</em></strong> work in hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare settings. They spend little time dispensing prescriptions. Instead, they are involved in direct patient care. Clinical pharmacists may go on rounds in a hospital with a physician or healthcare team. They recommend medications to give to patients and oversee the dosage and timing of the delivery of those medications. They also may conduct some medical tests and offer advice to patients. For example, pharmacists working in a diabetes clinic may counsel patients on how and when to take medications, suggest healthy food choices, and monitor patients’ blood sugar.</p>,<p><strong><em>Consultant pharmacists</em></strong> advise healthcare facilities or insurance providers on patient medication use or improving pharmacy services. They also may give advice directly to patients, such as helping seniors manage their prescriptions.</p>,<p><strong><em>Pharmaceutical industry pharmacists</em></strong> work in areas such as marketing, sales, or research and development. They may design or conduct clinical drug trials and help to develop new drugs. They may also help to establish safety regulations and ensure quality control for drugs.</p>,<p>Some pharmacists work as college professors. They may teach pharmacy students or conduct research.

"<p>Fashion designers create original clothing, accessories, and footwear. They sketch designs, select fabrics and patterns, and give instructions on how to make the products they design.</p>,<p>Fashion designers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Larger apparel companies typically employ a team of designers headed by a creative director. Some fashion designers specialize in clothing, footwear, or accessory design; others create designs in all three fashion categories.</p>,<p>For some fashion designers, the first step in creating a new design is researching current fashion and making predictions about future trends, such as by reading reports published by fashion industry trade groups. Other fashion designers create collections using a variety of inspirations, including art media, their surroundings, or cultures they have experienced and places they have visited.</p>,<p>After they have an initial idea, fashion designers try out various fabrics and produce a prototype, often with less expensive material than will be used in the final product. They work with models to see how the design will look and adjust the designs as needed.</p>,<p>Although most designers first sketch their designs by hand, many now also sketch their ideas digitally with computer-aided design (CAD) programs. CAD allows designers to see their work on virtual models. They can try different colors, designs, and shapes while making adjustments more easily than they can when working with real fabric on real people.</p>,<p>Designers produce samples with the actual materials that will be used in manufacturing. Samples that get good responses from fashion editors or trade and fashion shows are then manufactured and sold to consumers.</p>,<p>The design process may vary by specialty, but it generally takes 6 months, from initial design concept to final production, to release either the spring or fall collection. In addition to releasing designs during the spring and fall, some companies release new designs every month.</p>,<p>The Internet and e-commerce allow fashion designers to offer their products outside of traditional brick-and-mortar stores. These designers ship directly to the consumer, without having to invest in a physical shop to showcase their product lines of collections.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of fashion designers:</p>,<p><strong><em>Accessory designers</em></strong> design and produce items such as handbags, suitcases, belts, scarves, hats, hosiery, and eyewear.</p>,<p><strong><em>Costume designers</em></strong> design costumes for the performing arts and for motion picture and television productions. They research the styles worn during the period in which the performance is set, or they work with directors to select and create appropriate attire. They also must stay within the production’s costume budget.</p>,<p><strong><em>Clothing designers</em></strong> create and help produce men’s, women’s, and children’s apparel, including casual wear, suits, sportswear, evening wear, outerwear, maternity clothing, and intimate apparel.</p>,<p><strong><em>Footwear designers</em></strong> create and help produce different styles of shoes and boots.

"<p>Software developers are the creative minds behind computer programs. Some develop the applications that allow people to do specific tasks on a computer or another device. Others develop the underlying systems that run the devices or that control networks.</p>,<p>Software developers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Software developers are in charge of the entire development process for a software program. They may begin by asking how the customer plans to use the software. They must identify the core functionality that users need from software programs. Software developers must also determine user requirements that are unrelated to the functions of the software, such as the level of security and performance needs. They design the program and then give instructions to programmers, who write computer code and test it.</p>,<p>If the program does not work as expected or if testers find it too difficult to use, software developers go back to the design process to fix the problems or improve the program. After the program is released to the customer, a developer may perform upgrades and maintenance.</p>,<p>Developers usually work closely with computer programmers. However, in some companies, developers write code themselves instead of giving instructions to programmers.</p>,<p>Developers who supervise a software project from the planning stages through implementation sometimes are called information technology (IT) project managers. These workers monitor the project’s progress to ensure that it meets deadlines, standards, and cost targets.

"<p>Computer systems analysts, sometimes called <em>systems architects</em>, study an organization’s current computer systems and procedures, and design solutions to help the organization operate more efficiently and effectively. They bring business and information technology (IT) together by understanding the needs and limitations of both.</p>,<p>Computer systems analysts typically do the following:</p>,<p>Most computer systems analysts specialize in computer systems that are specific to the organization they work with. For example, an analyst might work predominantly with financial computer systems or with engineering computer systems. Computer systems analysts help other IT team members understand how computer systems can best serve an organization by working closely with the organization’s business leaders.</p>,<p>Computer systems analysts use a variety of techniques, such as data modeling, to design computer systems. Data modeling allows analysts to view processes and data flows. Analysts conduct indepth tests and analyze information and trends in the data to increase a system’s performance and efficiency.</p>,<p>Analysts calculate requirements for how much memory, storage, and computing power the computer system needs. They prepare flowcharts or other kinds of diagrams for programmers or engineers to use when building the system. Analysts also work with these people to solve problems that arise after the initial system is set up.

If they do not work correctly, computer programmers check the code for mistakes and fix them.</p>,<p>Computer programmers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Programmers work closely with software developers, and in some businesses their duties overlap. When such overlap occurs, programmers can do work that is typical of developers, such as designing programs. Program design entails planning the software initially, creating models and flowcharts detailing how the code is to be written, writing and debugging code, and designing an application or systems interface.</p>,<p>A program’s purpose determines the complexity of its computer code. For example, a weather application for a mobile device will require less programming than a social-networking application. Simpler programs can be written in less time. Complex programs, such as computer operating systems, can take a year or more to complete.</p>,<p>Software-as-a-service (SaaS), which consists of applications provided through the Internet, is a growing field. Although programmers typically need to rewrite their programs to work on different system platforms, such as Windows or OS X, applications created with SaaS work on all platforms.

For example, lasers are often used for cutting and improving the quality of stones, for intricate engraving or design work, and for inscribing personal messages on jewelry. Jewelers also use lasers to weld metals together without seams or blemishes, improving the quality and appearance of jewelry.</p>,<p>Some manufacturing firms use computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) to make product design easier and to automate some steps. With CAD, jewelers can create a model of a piece of jewelry on a computer and then view the effect of changing different aspects—for example, the design, the stone, or the setting—before cutting a stone or taking other costly steps. With CAM, they can then create a mold of the piece, which makes producing many copies easy.</p>,<p>Some jewelers also use CAD software to design custom jewelry. They let the customer review the design on a computer and see the effect of changes, so that the customer is satisfied before committing to the expense of a customized piece of jewelry.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of jewelers and precious stone and metal workers:</p>,<p><strong><em>Bench jewelers, </em></strong>also known as metalsmiths, silversmiths, goldsmiths, and platinumsmiths, are the most common type of jewelers.

Appraisers photograph the outside of the building and some of the interior features to document its condition. After visiting the property, the appraiser analyzes the property relative to comparable home sales, including lease records, location, view, previous appraisals, and income potential. During the entire process, appraisers record their research, observations, and methods used in providing an estimate of the property’s value.</p>,<p><strong><em>Assessors</em></strong> value properties for property tax assessments. Most work for local governments. Unlike appraisers, who generally focus on one property at a time, assessors often value an entire neighborhood of homes at once by using mass appraisal techniques and computer-assisted appraisal systems.</p>,<p>Assessors must be up to date on tax assessment procedures. Taxpayers sometimes challenge the assessed value because they feel they are being charged too much for property tax. Assessors must be able to defend the accuracy of their property assessments, either to the owner directly or at a public hearing.</p>,<p>Assessors also keep a database of every property in their jurisdiction, identifying the property owner, assessment history, and characteristics of the property, as well as property maps detailing the property distribution of the jurisdiction.</p>",    Bachelor's degree,    Appraisers and Assessors of Real Estate,"<li>Verify legal descriptions of real estate properties in public records</li>,<li>Inspect new and existing properties, noting the characteristics</li>,<li>Photograph the interior and exterior of properties</li>,<li>Analyze “comparables,” or similar nearby properties, to help provide values</li>,<li>Prepare written reports on the property values</li>,<li>Prepare and maintain current data on each real estate property</li>,<li>Commercial appraisers specialize in income-producing properties, such as office buildings, stores, and hotels.</li>,<li>Residential appraisers focus on appraising properties in which people live, such as single unit homes and condominiums.

Boilers heat water or other fluids under extreme pressure to generate electric power and to provide heat. Large tanks and vats are used to process and store chemicals, oil, beer, and hundreds of other products.</p>,<p>Boilers are made out of steel, iron, copper, or stainless steel. Manufacturers are increasingly automating the production of boilers to improve the quality of these vessels. However, boilermakers still use many tools to assemble and maintain boilers. For example, they often use hand and power tools and flame-cutting torches to align, cut, and shape pieces for a boiler. Boilermakers also use plumb bobs, levels, wedges, and turnbuckles to align pieces accurately.</p>,<p>During a boiler installation, boilermakers first line up boilerplates and parts, and then use metalworking machinery and other tools to remove irregular edges so that the parts fit together properly. If the plate sections are very large, boilermakers signal crane operators to lift the parts into place. Boilermakers then join the parts by bolting, welding, and riveting them together.</p>,<p>Boilermakers may help erect and repair air pollution abatement equipment, blast furnaces, water treatment plants, storage and process tanks, and smokestacks. Boilermakers also install refractory brick and other heat-resistant materials in fireboxes or pressure vessels.

"<p>Carpenters construct, repair, and install building frameworks and structures made from wood and other materials.</p>,<p>Carpenters typically do the following:</p>,<p>Carpenters are a versatile occupation in the construction industry, with workers usually doing many different tasks. For example, some carpenters insulate office buildings and others install drywall or kitchen cabinets in homes. Those who help construct tall buildings or bridges often install wooden concrete forms for cement footings or pillars and are commonly referred to as <em>rough carpenters</em>. Rough carpenters also erect shoring and scaffolding for buildings.</p>,<p>Carpenters use many different tools to cut and shape wood, plastic, fiberglass, or drywall. They commonly use hand tools, including squares, levels, and chisels, as well as many power tools, such as sanders, circular saws, nail guns, and welding machines.</p>,<p>Carpenters fasten materials together with nails, screws, staples, and adhesives, and check their work to ensure that it is precisely completed. They use tape measures on nearly every project to quickly measure distances. Many employers require applicants to supply their own tools.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of carpenters:</p>,<p><strong><em>Construction carpenters</em></strong> construct, install, and repair structures and fixtures of wood, plywood, and wallboard, using carpenter’s hand tools and power tools.</p>,<p><strong><em>Rough carpenters</em></strong> build rough wooden structures, such as concrete forms; scaffolds; tunnel, bridge, or sewer supports; and temporary frame shelters, according to sketches, blueprints, or oral instructions.</p>",    High school diploma or equivalent,    Carpenters,"<li>Follow blueprints and building plans to meet the needs of clients</li>,<li>Install structures and fixtures, such as windows and molding</li>,<li>Measure, cut, and shape wood, plastic, and other materials</li>,<li>Construct building frameworks, including walls, floors, and doorframes</li>,<li>Erect, level, and install building framework with the aid of rigging hardware and cranes</li>,<li>Inspect and replace damaged framework or other structures and fixtures</li>,<li>Instruct and direct laborers and other construction helpers</li>"
"<p>Electricians install, maintain, and repair electrical power, communications, lighting, and control systems in homes, businesses, and factories.</p>,<p>Electricians typically do the following:</p>,<p>Almost every building has an electrical power, communications, lighting, and control system that is installed during construction and maintained after that. These systems power the lights, appliances, and equipment that make people’s lives and jobs easier and more comfortable.</p>,<p>Installing electrical systems in newly constructed buildings is often less complicated than maintaining equipment in existing buildings because electrical wiring is more easily accessible during construction. Maintaining equipment and systems involves identifying problems and repairing broken equipment that is sometimes difficult to reach. Maintenance work may include fixing or replacing parts, light fixtures, control systems, motors, and other types of electrical equipment.</p>,<p>Electricians read blueprints, which include technical diagrams of electrical systems that show the location of circuits, outlets, and other equipment. They use different types of handtools and power tools, such as conduit benders, to run and protect wiring. Other commonly used tools include screwdrivers, wire strippers, drills, and saws. While troubleshooting, electricians also may use ammeters, voltmeters, thermal scanners, and cable testers to find problems and ensure that components are working properly.</p>,<p>Many electricians work alone, but sometimes they collaborate with others. For example, experienced electricians may work with building <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/civil-engineers.htm#tab-1"">engineers</a> and <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/architects.htm"">architects</a> to help design electrical systems for new construction.

"<p>Glaziers install glass in windows, skylights, and other fixtures in storefronts and buildings.</p>,<p>Glaziers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Glass has many uses in everyday life. For example, insulated and specially treated glass keeps in warm or cool air and controls sound and condensation. Tempered and laminated glass makes doors and windows more secure by making them less prone to breaking. Glaziers specialize in installing these different glass products.</p>,<p>In homes, glaziers install or replace windows, mirrors, shower doors, and bathtub enclosures. They fit glass for tabletops and display cases. On commercial interior projects, glaziers install items such as room dividers and security windows. Glazing projects may also involve exterior work such as replacing storefront windows for supermarkets, auto dealerships, banks, and other establishments.</p>,<p>For most large-scale construction jobs, glass is precut and mounted into frames at a factory or a contractor’s shop. The finished glass arrives at the jobsite ready for glaziers to position and secure into place. Using cranes or hoists with suction cups, workers lift large, heavy pieces of glass for installation. In cases where the glass is not secure inside the frame, glaziers may attach steel and aluminum sashes or frames to the building, and then secure the glass with clips, moldings, or other types of fasteners.</p>,<p>Many windows are now being covered with laminates—a thin film or coating placed over the glass. These coatings provide additional durability, security, and can add color or tint to interior and exterior glass. The laminate also provides safety benefits by making glass less prone to shattering, which makes it ideal for commercial use.</p>,<p>Workers who replace and repair glass in motor vehicles are covered in the <a href=""/ooh/installation-maintenance-and-repair/automotive-body-and-glass-repairers.htm""><u>automotive body and glass repairers</u></a> profile.</p>",    High school diploma or equivalent,    Glaziers,"<li>Follow blueprints and specifications</li>,<li>Remove any old or broken glass before installing replacement glass</li>,<li>Cut glass to the specified size and shape</li>,<li>Use measuring tape, plumb lines, and levels to ensure proper fitting installation</li>,<li>Make or install sashes and moldings for glass installation</li>,<li>Fasten glass into sashes or frames with clips, moldings, or other types of fasteners</li>,<li>Add weather seal or putty around pane edges to seal joints</li>"
"<p>Flooring installers and tile and marble setters lay and finish carpet, wood, vinyl, and tile.</p>,<p>Flooring installers and tile and marble setters typically do the following:</p>,<p>Nearly every building has a finished floor, and flooring installers and tile and marble setters lay the materials that improve the look and feel of homes, offices, restaurants, and other buildings. Although most of the materials installed by these workers cover only floors, some materials are also installed on walls and countertops or in showers.</p>,<p>A smooth, even base of mortar or plywood is required for floors and tile to be installed. The base may be installed by flooring installers and tile and marble setters or by other construction craftworkers. When remodeling, workers may need to remove the old flooring and smooth the surface.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of flooring installers and tile and marble setters:</p>,<p><strong><em>Carpet installers</em></strong> lay lengths of carpet on new floors or over older flooring. They use special tools, including “knee kickers” to position the carpet and power stretchers to pull the carpet snugly against walls. Installers also join edges of carpet and seam edges where necessary, by sewing or by using tape with glue and a heated carpet iron.</p>,<p><strong><em>Carpet tile installers </em></strong>lay small, modular pieces of carpet that may be glued into place. Carpet tiles allow for easy replacement and design patterns that are not possible with standard carpet.</p>,<p><strong><em>Floor sanders and finishers</em></strong> perform the final steps in hardwood floor installation. After <a href=""/ooh/construction-and-extraction/carpenters.htm""><u>carpenters</u></a> install the hardwood floor, workers use power sanders to smooth it. They apply stains and sealants to preserve the wood.</p>,<p><strong><em>Floor layers, except carpet, wood, and hard tiles,</em></strong> install a wide variety of resilient flooring materials. <strong><em>Linoleum installers</em></strong> lay the hard, washable floor material of the same name. The linoleum is cut to size and glued into place. <strong><em>Vinyl installers</em></strong> install plastic-based flooring that includes vinyl ester, vinyl sheeting, and vinyl tile. Installers of laminate, manufactured wood, and wood tile floors are included in this category.</p>,<p><strong><em>Tile and marble setters</em></strong> install ceramic and marble tile. <strong><em>Tile installers</em></strong>, sometimes called <strong><em>tile setters,</em></strong> cut and place tile. To cut tiles, workers use wet saws, tile scribes, or handheld tile cutters to create even edges. They use trowels of different sizes to spread mortar or a sticky paste, called mastic, evenly on the surface to be tiled. To minimize imperfections and keep rows even, they put spacers between tiles. Spacers keep tiles the same distance from each other until the mortar is dry. <strong><em>Tile finishers</em></strong> apply grout between tiles after the tiles are set, using a rubber trowel called a float. When the grout dries, they must wipe the tiles for a clean, finished look. <strong><em>Marble setters</em></strong> cut marble to a specified size with a wet saw. After fastening the stone, marble setters polish the marble to a high luster, using hand or power sanders.</p>",    No formal educational credential,    Flooring Installers and Tile and Marble Setters,"<li>Remove existing flooring or wall covering</li>,<li>Clean and level the surface to be covered</li>,<li>Measure the area and cut flooring material to fit</li>,<li>Arrange flooring according to design plans</li>,<li>Place flooring, using adhesives, nails, or staples</li>,<li>Fill joints with filler compound and remove excess compound</li>,<li>Trim excess carpet or linoleum</li>,<li>Apply necessary finishes, such as sealants and stains</li>"
"<p>Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters install and repair pipes that carry liquids or gases to, from, and within businesses, homes, and factories.</p>,<p>Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters typically do the following:</p>,<p>The movement of liquids and gases through pipes is critical to modern life. In homes, water is needed for both drinking and sanitation. In factories, chemicals are moved to aid in product manufacturing. In power plants, steam is moved to drive turbines that generate electricity. Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters install and repair these pipe systems.</p>,<p>Although plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters perform three distinct and specialized roles, their duties are often similar. For example, they all install pipes and fittings that carry water, steam, air, or other liquids or gases. They determine the necessary materials for a job, connect pipes, and perform pressure tests to ensure that a pipe system is airtight and watertight. Their tools include drills, saws, welding torches, and wrenches.</p>,<p>Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters may use many different materials and construction techniques, depending on the type of project. Residential water systems, for example, use copper, steel, and plastic pipe that one or two plumbers can install. Power plant water systems, by contrast, are made of large steel pipes that usually take a crew of pipefitters to install. Some workers install stainless steel pipes on dairy farms and in factories, mainly to prevent contamination.</p>,<p>In addition to performing installation and repair work, journey- and master-level plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters frequently direct apprentices and helpers.</p>,<p>Master plumbers on construction jobs may be involved with developing blueprints that show the placement of all the pipes and fixtures. Their input helps ensure that a structure’s plumbing meets building codes, stays within budget, and works well with the location of other features, such as electric wires. Many diagrams are now created digitally with the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM), which allows a building’s physical systems to be planned and coordinated across occupations.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters:</p>,<p><strong><em>Plumbers</em></strong> install and repair water, drainage, gas, and other piping systems in homes, businesses, and factories. Plumbers install plumbing fixtures such as bathtubs and toilets, and appliances, such as dishwashers and water heaters. Plumbers also maintain septic systems—the large, underground holding tanks that collect waste from houses that are not connected to a sewer system.</p>,<p><strong><em>Pipefitters</em></strong>, sometimes simply called <em>fitters</em>, install and maintain pipes that carry chemicals, acids, and gases. These pipes are used mostly in manufacturing, commercial, and industrial settings.

"<p>Zoologists and wildlife biologists study animals and other wildlife and how they interact with their ecosystems. They study the physical characteristics of animals, animal behaviors, and the impacts humans have on wildlife and natural habitats.</p>,<p>Zoologists and wildlife biologists typically do the following:</p>,<p>Zoologists and wildlife biologists perform a variety of scientific tests and experiments. For example, they take blood samples from animals to assess their nutrition levels, check animals for disease and parasites, and tag animals in order to track them. Although the roles and abilities of zoologists and wildlife biologists often overlap, zoologists typically conduct scientific investigations and basic research on particular types of animals, such as birds or amphibians, whereas wildlife biologists are more likely to study specific ecosystems or animal populations, such as a particular at-risk species. Wildlife biologists also do applied work, such as the conservation and management of wildlife populations.</p>,<p>Zoologists and wildlife biologists use geographic information systems (GIS), modeling software, and other computer programs to estimate wildlife populations and track the movements of animals. They also use these computer programs to forecast the spread of invasive species or diseases, project changes in the availability of habitat, and assess other potential threats to wildlife.</p>,<p>Zoologists and wildlife biologists conduct research for a variety of purposes. For example, many zoologists and wildlife biologists work to increase our knowledge and understanding of wildlife species. Traditionally, many wildlife biologists researched ways to encourage abundant game animal populations to support recreational hunting and tourism. Today, many also work with public officials in conservation efforts that protect species from threats and help animal populations return to and remain at sustainable levels.</p>,<p>Most zoologists and wildlife biologists work on research teams with other scientists and technicians. For example, zoologists and wildlife biologists may work with <a href=""/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/environmental-scientists-and-specialists.htm""><u>environmental scientists</u></a> and <a href=""/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/hydrologists.htm""><u>hydrologists</u></a> to monitor water pollution and its effects on fish populations.</p>,<p>Zoologists generally specialize first in either vertebrates or invertebrates and then in specific species.

Insurance underwriters use computer software programs to determine whether to approve an applicant. They take specific information about a client and enter it into a program. The program then provides recommendations on coverage and premiums. Underwriters evaluate these recommendations and decide whether to approve or reject the application. If a decision is difficult, they may consult additional sources, such as medical documents and credit scores.</p>,<p>For simple and common types of insurance, such as automobile insurance, underwriters can typically rely on automated recommendations. For more specific and complex insurance types, such as workers’ compensation, underwriters need to rely more on their own analytical insight.</p>,<p>Underwriters analyze the risk factors appearing on an application. For instance, if an applicant reports a previous bankruptcy, the underwriter must determine whether that information is relevant to the policy being applied for. The underwriter would likely consider how far in the past the bankruptcy occurred and how the applicant’s financial situation has changed since the applicant filed for bankruptcy.</p>,<p>Insurance underwriters must achieve a balance between risky and cautious decisions. If underwriters allow too much risk, the insurance company will pay out too many claims. But if they don’t approve enough applications, the company will not make enough money from premiums.</p>,<p>Most insurance underwriters specialize in one of three broad fields: life, health, and property and casualty. Although the job duties in each field are similar, the criteria that underwriters use vary. For example, for someone seeking life insurance, underwriters consider the person’s age and financial history. For someone applying for car insurance (a form of property and casualty insurance), underwriters consider the person’s driving record.</p>,<p>Within the broad field of property and casualty, underwriters may specialize even further into commercial (business) insurance or personal insurance.

Line installers and repairers, also known as <em>line workers</em>, are responsible for installing and maintaining these networks.</p>,<p>Line installers and repairers can specialize in different areas depending on the type of network and industry in which they work:</p>,<p><strong><em>Electrical power-line installers and repairers</em></strong> install and maintain the power grid—the network of power lines that moves electricity from generating plants to customers. They routinely work with high-voltage electricity, which requires extreme caution. The electrical current can range from hundreds of thousands of volts for long-distance transmission lines that make up the power grid to less than 10,000 volts for distribution lines that supply electricity to homes and businesses.</p>,<p>Line workers who maintain the interstate power grid work in crews that travel to locations throughout a large region to service transmission lines and towers. Workers employed by local utilities work mainly with lower voltage distribution lines, maintaining equipment such as transformers, voltage regulators, and switches. They also may work on traffic lights and street lights.</p>,<p><strong><em>Telecommunications line installers and repairers</em></strong> install and maintain the lines and cables used by network communications companies. Depending on the service provided—local and long-distance telephone, cable television, or Internet—telecommunications companies use different types of cables, including fiber optic cables. Unlike metallic cables that carry electricity, fiber optic cables are made of glass and transmit signals using light. Working with fiber optics requires special skills, such as the ability to splice and terminate optical cables. In addition, workers use specialized equipment to test and troubleshoot cables and networking equipment.</p>,<p>Because these systems are complicated, many line workers also specialize by duty:</p>,<p><strong><em>Line installers</em></strong> install new cable. They may work for construction contractors, utilities, or telecommunications companies. Workers generally start a new job by digging underground trenches or erecting utility poles and towers to carry the wires and cables. They use a variety of construction equipment, including digger derricks, which are trucks equipped with augers and cranes used to dig holes and set poles in place. Line installers also use trenchers, cable plows, and directional bore machines, which are used to cut openings in the earth to lay underground cables. Once the poles, towers, tunnels, or trenches are ready, workers install the new cable.</p>,<p><strong><em>Line repairers</em></strong> are employed by utilities and telecommunications companies that maintain existing power and telecommunications lines. Maintenance needs may be identified in a variety of ways, including remote monitoring, aerial inspections, and by customer reports of service outages. Line repairers often must replace aging or outdated equipment, so many of these workers have installation duties in addition to their repair duties.</p>,<p>When a problem is reported, line repairers must identify the cause and fix it. This usually involves diagnostic testing using specialized equipment and repair work.

Parole officers monitor post-release parolees and provide them with information on various resources, such as substance abuse counseling or job training, to aid in their rehabilitation. By doing so, the officers try to change the parolee’s behavior and thus reduce the risk of that person committing another crime and having to return to prison.</p>,<p>Both probation and parole officers supervise probationers and parolees through personal contact with them and their families (also known as community supervision). Probation and parole officers require regularly scheduled contact with parolees and probationers by telephone or through office visits, and they also check on them at their homes or places of work. When making home visits, probation and parole officers take into account the safety of the neighborhood in which the probationers and parolees live and any mental health considerations that may be pertinent.

"<p>Dietitians and nutritionists are experts in the use of food and nutrition to promote health and manage disease. They advise people on what to eat in order to lead a healthy lifestyle or achieve a specific health-related goal.</p>,<p>Dietitians and nutritionists typically do the following:</p>,<p>Dietitians and nutritionists evaluate the health of their clients. Based on their findings, dietitians and nutritionists advise clients on which foods to eat—and which to avoid—to improve their health.</p>,<p>Many dietitians and nutritionists provide customized information for specific individuals. For example, a dietitian or nutritionist might teach a client with diabetes how to plan meals to balance the client’s blood sugar. Others work with groups of people who have similar needs. For example, a dietitian or nutritionist might plan a diet with healthy fat and limited sugar to help clients who are at risk for heart disease. They may work with other healthcare professionals to coordinate patient care.</p>,<p>Dietitians and nutritionists who are self-employed may meet with patients, or they may work as consultants for a variety of organizations. They may need to spend time on marketing and other business-related tasks, such as scheduling appointments, keeping records, and preparing educational programs or informational materials for clients.</p>,<p>Although many dietitians and nutritionists do similar tasks, there are several specialties within the occupations. The following are examples of types of dietitians and nutritionists:</p>,<p><strong><em>Clinical dietitians and clinical nutritionists</em></strong> provide medical nutrition therapy.

"<p>Epidemiologists are public health professionals who investigate patterns and causes of disease and injury in humans. They seek to reduce the risk and occurrence of negative health outcomes through research, community education and health policy.</p>,<p>Epidemiologists typically do the following:</p>,<p>Epidemiologists collect and analyze data to investigate health issues. For example, an epidemiologist might collect and analyze demographic data to determine who is at the highest risk for a particular disease. They also may research and investigate the trends in populations of survivors of certain diseases, such as cancer, so that effective treatments can be identified and repeated across the population.</p>,<p>Epidemiologists typically work in applied public health or in research. Applied epidemiologists work for state and local governments, addressing public health problems directly. They often are involved with education outreach and survey efforts in communities.

"<p>Workers in railroad occupations ensure that passenger and freight trains run on time and travel safely. Some workers drive trains, some coordinate the activities of the trains, and others operate signals and switches in the rail yard.</p>,<p>Railroad workers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Freight trains move billions of tons of goods around the country to ports where they are shipped around the world. Passenger trains transport millions of passengers and commuters to destinations around the country. These railroad workers are essential to keeping freight and passenger trains running properly.</p>,<p>All workers in railroad occupations work together closely. Locomotive engineers travel with conductors and sometimes brake operators. Locomotive engineers and conductors are in constant contact and keep each other informed of any changes in the condition of the train.</p>,<p>Signal and switch operators communicate with both locomotive and rail yard engineers to make sure that trains end up at the correct destination. All occupations are in contact with dispatchers who give them directions on where to go and what to do.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of railroad workers:</p>,<p><strong><em>Locomotive engineers </em></strong>drive freight or passenger trains between stations. They drive long-distance trains and commuter trains, but not subway trains. Most locomotive engineers drive diesel-electric engines, although some drive locomotives powered by battery or electricity.</p>,<p>Engineers must be aware of the goods their train is carrying because different types of freight require different types of driving, based on the conditions of the rails. For example, a train carrying hazardous material through a snowstorm is driven differently than a train carrying coal through a mountain region.</p>,<p>Locomotive engineers typically do the following:</p>,<p><strong><em>Conductors</em></strong> travel on both freight and passenger trains. They coordinate activities of the train crew. On passenger trains, they ensure safety and comfort and make announcements to keep passengers informed. On freight trains they are responsible for overseeing the loading and unloading of cargo.</p>,<p>Conductors typically do the following:</p>,<p><strong><em>Yardmasters</em></strong> do work similar to that of conductors, except that they do not travel on trains. They oversee and coordinate the activities of workers in the rail yard. They tell yard engineers where to move cars to fit the planned configuration or to load freight. Yardmasters ensure that trains are carrying the correct material before leaving the yard. Not all rail yards use yardmasters. In rail yards that do not have yardmasters, a conductor performs the duties of a yardmaster.</p>,<p>Yardmasters typically do the following:</p>,<p><strong><em>Rail yard engineers </em></strong>operate train engines within the rail yard. They move locomotives between tracks to keep the trains organized and on schedule. Some operate small locomotives called dinkeys. Sometimes, rail yard engineers are called <em>hostlers </em>and drive locomotives to and from maintenance shops or prepare them for the locomotive engineer. Some use remote locomotive technology to move freight cars within the rail yards.</p>,<p><strong><em>Railroad brake, signal, or switch operators </em></strong>control equipment that keeps the trains running safely.</p>,<p>Brake operators help couple and uncouple train cars. Some travel with the train as part of the crew.</p>,<p>Signal operators install and maintain the signals along tracks and in the rail yard. Signals are important in preventing accidents because they allow increased communication between trains and dispatchers.</p>,<p>Switch operators control the track switches in rail yards. These switches allow trains to move between tracks and ensure trains are heading in the right direction.</p>,<p><strong><em>Locomotive firers </em></strong>are sometimes part of a train crew and typically monitor tracks and train instruments.

"<p>Waiters and waitresses take orders and serve food and beverages to customers in dining establishments.</p>,<p>Waiters and waitresses typically do the following:</p>,<p>Waiters and waitresses, also called <em>servers</em>, are responsible for ensuring that customers have a satisfying dining experience. The specific duties of servers vary with the establishment in which they work.</p>,<p>In casual-dining restaurants that offer simple menu items, such as salads, soups, and sandwiches, servers provide fast, efficient, and courteous service.

"<p>Loan officers evaluate, authorize, or recommend approval of loan applications for people and businesses.</p>,<p>Loan officers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Loan officers use a process called underwriting to assess whether applicants qualify for loans. After collecting and verifying all the required financial documents, the loan officer evaluates the information they obtain to determine the applicant’s need for a loan and ability to pay back the loan. Most firms use underwriting software, which produces a recommendation for the loan based on the applicant’s financial status. After the underwriting software produces a recommendation, loan officers review the output of the software and consider any additional information to make a final decision.</p>,<p>The work of loan officers has sizable customer-service and sales components. Loan officers often answer questions and guide customers through the application process. In addition, many loan officers must market the products and services of their lending institution and actively solicit new business.</p>,<p>The following are common types of loan officers:</p>,<p><strong><em>Commercial loan officers</em></strong> specialize in loans to businesses, which often use the loans to buy supplies and upgrade or expand operations. Commercial loans frequently are larger and more complicated than other types of loans. Because companies have such complex financial situations and statements, commercial loans usually require human judgment in addition to the analysis by underwriting software. Furthermore, some commercial loans are so large that no single bank will provide the entire amount requested. In such cases, loan officers may have to work with multiple banks to put together a package of loans.</p>,<p><strong><em>Consumer loan officers</em></strong> specialize in loans to people. Consumers take out loans for many reasons, such as buying a car or paying college tuition. For some simple consumer loans, the underwriting process is fully automated. However, the loan officer is still needed to guide applicants through the process and to handle cases with unusual circumstances. Some institutions—usually small banks and credit unions—do not use underwriting software and instead rely on loan officers to complete the underwriting process manually.</p>,<p><strong><em>Mortgage loan officers</em></strong> specialize in loans used to buy real estate (property and buildings), which are called mortgage loans. Mortgage loan officers work on loans for both residential and commercial properties. Often, mortgage loan officers must seek out clients, which requires developing relationships with real estate companies and other sources that can refer prospective applicants.</p>,<p>Within these three fields, some loan officers specialize in a particular part of the loan process:</p>,<p><strong><em>Loan collection officers</em></strong> contact borrowers who fail to make their loan payments on time. They work with borrowers to help them find a way to keep paying off the loan. If the borrower continues to miss payments, loan officers start the process of taking away what the borrower used to secure the loan (called “collateral”)—often a home or car—and selling it to repay the loan.</p>,<p><strong><em>Loan underwriters</em></strong> specialize in evaluating whether a client is creditworthy. They collect, verify, and evaluate the client’s financial information provided on their loan applications and then use loan underwriting software to produce recommendations.</p>",    Bachelor's degree,    Loan Officers,"<li>Contact companies or people to ask if they need a loan</li>,<li>Meet with loan applicants to gather personal information and answer questions</li>,<li>Explain different types of loans and the terms of each type to applicants</li>,<li>Obtain, verify, and analyze the applicant’s financial information, such as the credit rating and income level</li>,<li>Review loan agreements to ensure that they comply with federal and state regulations</li>,<li>Approve loan applications or refer them to management for a decision</li>"

They monitor social, economic, and political trends that might affect their organization, and they recommend ways to enhance the firm’s image on the basis of those trends. For example, in response to concern about damage to the environment, the public relations manager for an oil company may create a campaign to publicize its efforts to develop cleaner fuels.</p>,<p>In large organizations, public relations managers often supervise a staff of public relations specialists. They also work with advertising, promotions, and marketing managers to ensure that advertising campaigns are compatible with the image the company or client is trying to portray. For example, if a firm decides to emphasize its appeal to a certain group, such as young people, the public relations manager needs to make sure that current advertisements are well received by that group.</p>,<p>In addition, public relations managers may handle internal communications, such as company newsletters, and may help <a href=""/ooh/management/financial-managers.htm""><u>financial managers</u></a> produce an organization’s reports.

Many organizations that hire fundraising workers rely heavily on the donations they gather in order to run their operations.</p>,<p>Fundraising managers usually decide which fundraising techniques are necessary in a certain situation. Common techniques include annual campaigns, capital campaigns, planned giving, and soliciting for major gifts. Social media has created another avenue for fundraising managers to connect with potential donors and to spread their organization’s message.</p>,<p>Those who work on annual campaigns focus heavily on contacting donors who have given in the past to request that they give again. Finding new contacts for future donations is also part of a successful annual campaign.</p>,<p>In contrast, fundraising managers who work on capital campaigns generally focus on raising money over a short time period for a specific project, such as the construction of a new building at a university.</p>,<p>Fundraising managers who spend most of their time on planned giving must have specialized training in taxes related to gifts of stocks, bonds, charitable annuities, and real estate bequests in a will.

Translations often go through several revisions before becoming final.</p>,<p>Translation usually is done with computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools, in which a computer database of previously translated sentences or segments (called a “translation memory”) may be used to translate new text. CAT tools allow translators to work more efficiently and consistently. Translators also edit materials translated by computers, or machine translation. This process is called post-editing.</p>,<p>Interpretation and translation services are needed in virtually all subject areas. Although most interpreters and translators specialize in a particular field or industry, many have more than one area of specialization.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of interpreters and translators:</p>,<p><strong><em>Community interpreters</em></strong> work in community-based environments, providing vital language interpretation one-on-one or in group settings. Community interpreters often are needed at parent–teacher conferences, community events, business and public meetings, social and government agencies, new-home purchases, and many other work and community settings.</p>,<p><strong><em>Conference interpreters</em></strong> work at conferences that have non-English-speaking attendees. The work is often in the field of international business or diplomacy, although conference interpreters can interpret for any organization that works with speakers of foreign languages. Employers generally prefer more experienced interpreters who can convert two languages into one native language—for example, the ability to interpret from Spanish and French into English. For some positions, such as those with the United Nations, this qualification is required.</p>,<p>Conference interpreters often do simultaneous interpreting. Attendees at a conference or meeting who do not understand the language of the speaker wear earphones tuned to the interpreter who speaks the language they want to hear.</p>,<p><strong><em>Health or medical interpreters and translators</em></strong> typically work in healthcare settings and help patients communicate with doctors, nurses, technicians, and other medical staff. Interpreters and translators must have knowledge of medical terminology and of common medical terms in both languages. They may translate research material, regulatory information, pharmaceutical and informational brochures, patient consent documents, website information, and patients’ records from one language into another.</p>,<p>Healthcare or medical interpreters must be sensitive to patients’ personal circumstances, as well as maintain confidentiality and ethical standards. Interpretation may also be provided remotely, either by video relay or over the phone.</p>,<p><strong><em>Liaison or escort interpreters</em></strong> accompany either U.S. visitors abroad or foreign visitors in the United States who have limited English proficiency. Interpreting in both formal and informal settings, these specialists ensure that the visitors can communicate during their stay. Frequent travel is common for liaison or escort interpreters.</p>,<p><strong><em>Legal or judicial interpreters and translators</em></strong> typically work in courts and other legal settings. At hearings, arraignments, depositions, and trials, they help people who have limited English proficiency. Accordingly, they must understand legal terminology. Many court interpreters must sometimes read documents aloud in a language other than that in which they were written, a task known as sight translation. Legal or judiciary interpreters and translators must have a strong understanding of legal terminology.</p>,<p><strong><em>Literary translators</em></strong> convert journal articles, books, poetry, and short stories from one language into another language. They work to keep the tone, style, and meaning of the author’s work. Whenever possible, literary translators work closely with authors to capture the intended meaning, as well as the literary and cultural characteristics, of the original publication.</p>,<p><strong><em>Localizers</em></strong> adapt text and graphics used in a product or service from one language into another language, a task known as localization. Localization specialists work to make it appear as though the product originated in the country where it will be sold. They must not only know both languages, but also understand the technical information they are working with and the culture of the people who will be using the product or service. Localizers make extensive use of computer and web-based localization tools and generally work in teams.</p>,<p>Localization may include adapting websites, software, marketing materials, user documentation, and various other publications. Usually, these adaptations are related to products and services in information technology, manufacturing and other business sectors.</p>,<p><strong><em>Sign language interpreters</em></strong> facilitate communication between people who are deaf or hard of hearing and people who can hear. Sign language interpreters must be fluent in English and in American Sign Language (ASL), which combines signing, finger spelling, and specific body language. ASL is a separate language from English and has its own grammar.</p>,<p>Some interpreters specialize in other forms of interpreting for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p>,<p>Some people who are deaf or hard of hearing can lip-read English instead of signing in ASL. Interpreters who work with these people do “oral interpretation,” mouthing speech silently and very carefully so that their lips can be read easily. They also may use facial expressions and gestures to help the lip-reader understand.</p>,<p>Other modes of interpreting include cued speech, which uses hand shapes placed near the mouth to give lip-readers more information; signing exact English; and tactile signing, which is interpreting for people who are blind as well as deaf by making hand signs into the deaf and blind person’s hand.</p>,<p><strong><em>Trilingual interpreters</em></strong> facilitate communication among an English speaker, a speaker of another language, and an ASL user. They must have the versatility, adaptability, and cultural understanding necessary to interpret in all three languages without changing the fundamental meaning of the message.</p>",    Bachelor's degree,    Interpreters and Translators,"<li>Convert concepts in the source language to equivalent concepts in the target language</li>,<li>Compile information and technical terms into glossaries and terminology databases to be used in their oral renditions and translations</li>,<li>Speak, read, and write fluently in at least two languages, one of which is usually English</li>,<li>Relay the style and tone of the original language</li>,<li>Render spoken messages accurately, quickly, and clearly</li>,<li>Apply their cultural knowledge to render an accurate and meaningful interpretation or translation of the original message</li>,<li><strong>Simultaneous interpreters</strong> convey a spoken or signed message into another language at the same time someone is speaking or signing. Simultaneous interpreters must be familiar with the subject matter and maintain a high level of concentration to convey the message accurately and completely. Due to the mental fatigue involved, simultaneous interpreters may work in pairs or small teams if they are interpreting for long periods of time, such as in a court or conference setting.</li>,<li><strong>Consecutive interpreters</strong> convey the speaker’s or signer’s message in another language after they have stopped to allow for the interpretation. Note taking is generally an essential part of consecutive interpreting.</li>,<li><strong>Sight translation interpreters</strong> provide translation of a written document directly into a spoken language, for immediate understanding, but not for the purposes of producing a written translated document.</li>"

"<p>Petroleum engineers design and develop methods for extracting oil and gas from deposits below the Earth’s surface. Petroleum engineers also find new ways to extract oil and gas from older wells.</p>,<p>Petroleum engineers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Oil and gas deposits, or reservoirs, are located deep in rock formations underground. These reservoirs can be accessed only by drilling wells, either on land, or at sea from offshore oil rigs.</p>,<p>Once oil and gas are discovered, petroleum engineers work with <a href=""/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/geoscientists.htm""><u>geoscientists</u></a> and other specialists to understand the geologic formation of the rock containing the reservoir. They then determine the drilling methods, design the drilling equipment, implement the drilling plan, and monitor operations.</p>,<p>The best techniques currently being used recover only a portion of the oil and gas in a reservoir, so petroleum engineers also research and develop new ways to recover more of the oil and gas. This additional recovery helps to lower the cost of drilling and production.</p>,<p>The following are examples of types of petroleum engineers:</p>,<p><strong><em>Completions engineers</em></strong> decide the best way to finish building wells so that oil or gas will flow up from underground. They oversee work to complete the building of wells—a project that might involve the use of tubing, hydraulic fracturing, or pressure-control techniques.</p>,<p><strong><em>Drilling engineers</em></strong> determine the best way to drill oil or gas wells, taking into account a number of factors, including cost. They also ensure that the drilling process is safe, efficient, and minimally disruptive to the environment.</p>,<p><strong><em>Production engineers</em></strong> take over wells after drilling is completed. They typically monitor wells’ oil and gas production. If wells are not producing as much as expected, production engineers figure out ways to increase the amount being extracted.</p>,<p><strong><em>Reservoir engineers</em></strong> estimate how much oil or gas can be recovered from underground deposits, known as reservoirs. They study reservoirs’ characteristics and determine which methods will get the most oil or gas out of the reservoirs.

"<p>Roofers replace, repair, and install the roofs of buildings, using a variety of materials, including shingles, bitumen, and metal.</p>,<p>Roofers typically do the following:</p>,<p>Properly installed roofs keep water from leaking into buildings and damaging the interior, equipment, or furnishings. There are two basic types of roofs: low-slope roofs and steep-slope roofs.</p>,<p>Low-slope roofs rise less than 3 inches per horizontal foot and are installed in layers. Most commercial, industrial, and apartment buildings have low-slope roofs, making them the most common roofing type. The complexity of low-slope roof installations varies with the type of building. When installing low-slope roofs, roofers typically install a single-ply membrane of a waterproof rubber or thermoplastic compound.</p>,<p>Steep-slope roofs rise more than 3 inches per horizontal foot and are typically covered with asphalt shingles, which often cost less than other materials. Most single-family homes have roofs with asphalt shingles. Although less common, roofers can also lay tile, solar shingles, metal shingles, or shakes (rough wooden shingles) on steep-slope roofs.</p>,<p>Roofing systems may also incorporate plants and landscape materials. A vegetative roof, for example, is typically a waterproof low-slope roof covered by a root barrier and harboring soil, plants, and landscaping materials.</p>,<p>It is becoming increasingly popular to take advantage of solar energy on rooftops. Roofs may incorporate solar reflective systems, which prevent the absorption of energy; solar thermal systems, which absorb energy to heat water; and solar photovoltaic systems, which convert sunlight into electricity.
